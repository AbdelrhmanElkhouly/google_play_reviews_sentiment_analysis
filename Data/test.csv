Great plateform for conducting meeting. need improvement like some control upfront,2
An excellent application experience. It runs seamlessly in all the fronts. Connectivity is no more an issue. You would always find the operational information before you. Looking forward the similar experience in future as well.,2
"Very Good,But please provide more options Mobile Phone users.Thank You For Taking Feedback, Good Job.",2
I am reinstalling this application can't open the assignments on one go.,0
"Superior, Reliable, Unbeatable, as long as you can read it works every time!",2
The newer the updates get the worst the app is. There is a mobile glitch in assignments that you can't open a pdf file ( I don't know about any other files) I hope this app will improve updates.,0
"This app was easy to use before. But after some days, my camera went blur and sides of the camera went black. So I use uninstall and reinstall it. But nowadays, I restart my tablet, reinstall it for a thousand times but nothing works for fixing this camera. My camera works in other applications well but not in meet.",0

This is so wrost app when I download 🤬🤬 this is automaticially restart download and take my 500 MB of data .,0
I think it was okay but it was hard to hear everyone.it needs to be more controlled when counsel members want to comment on item at hand. Too much feedback noise tonight. Great job Mayor,2
Excellent experience,2
Experience was great. Everything such as sound and video worked very well. I would've liked to test it all just to be sure before joining the actual meeting but turned out a very smooth experience.,2
"Extreme difficulty connecting. Lots of echo. It was our first time using this platform, but compared to others, it was very complicated, not intuitive and required vastly more time to set up.",0
Crashing problems,1
This app is quite good and I have been using for the past couple of years but off late it is not allowing me to share youtube video with my students. It is really giving a lot of trouble right now. Please do something and fix the problem.,0

Love it,2
Poor options. 1.No white board option ( where lecturer can explain his/her work by writing). 2. Also it would helpful if there is options like subtitles/captions for English language. 3. There must be an files section where i can see recordings of the meeting. 4. No option to delete message when I accidentally sent,0
So far so good. There was a glitch were I wasn't able to hear the person speaking even though their screen had the green outline signaling that they were indeed speaking and I'm unsure if it was my internet or the zoom app that's why I'm rating with for stars.,2
"Wow zoom meetings is great try to use it i pledge to you that you won't regret using this app,you will be able to communicate with other people from far places without any problems try it you will see for your self",2

I enter my username and password and then it shows three screens successively and when I click on got it, it says your all done for now hang up while we get things ready to you.

Good tool,2
If i join in the meet i can't hear the voice of others and can't see the screen presenting by others because of it i can't attend my class and also it was automatically exiting from the class,0
"Very easy to use, nicely done",2
Very worest audio and strucking in between.,0
"Zoom is very functional and largely intuitive, and it will be cool when they figure out how to deal with more than one person speaking at the same time.",2
"Many issues. 1. When network is switched, audio reconnection takes little time, 2. When waiting for the organizer, and the orginiser starts the meeting, the auto joining not happening (on Poco F1), 3. Sometimes issue #1 occurs in happy scenario of issue #2(i.e., joined, but audio not connected).",1

"Led light notifications don't appear on Samsung. They work perfectly for *every* app, including trash mobile games, but Microsoft once again wrote something special.

I have Teams on my phone and laptop for work. If I try to have a conversation on the phone app then the other person's responses don't show up unless I leave the chat and come back in. Also it has started to constantly request me to login again whenever the app opens. The app is really starting to annoy me.,0

"This has to be the worst video conferencing program ever. Trying to log in. The program goes to a looping system which continuously asks for log in information or reset password. This is a complete waste of an app. If I could convince my clients to use something different I would, unfortunately Microsoft was able to convince them that other (and better) apps have security issues which are completely not true today. Typical Microsoft style, release a program...work out the bugs later...",0

"Tried on a android phone, could not send video, had alot of trouble with audio",1
I hope you can add background.,1
Zoom please fix the whiteboard. I'm not able to draw anymore. Also if i play music on a speaker and speak at the same time it cuts the music out weirdly. This is not a problem with my phone because for example on Facebook live i CAN speak and have music playing at the same time.,0
"It works. No issues on my PC or Android phone, or just plain calling in.",2
"simple, easy to use, works great w outlook",2
Very convenient,2

"Annoying bleeps when people enter and leave the meeting, which can happen several times on unstable internet connection.",0
Just installed the app and I haven't used it much.,2
There is no virtual background in my app while others have. Please fix this for me and I´ll rate 5 stars for you.,0
"I'm leaving a middling review because this app nags you to leave reviews periodically. So, -1 point for the aggressive review farming. Inferior to slack for chat and superior to zoom for video conferences. My biggest problem with this app is the inability to search and find a conversation in context. You can search, but you can't go to a chat at the line of the search result and see the surrounding conversation. This is something that should just work in a chat app. -1 for that.",1
Great app great idea,2
I hate this but sometimes good. It is sticking so much not working also I have to delete and re download,0
Marvellous! I missed it,2
"Very user-friendly system. Allows for phone calls, team meetings and the ability to record.",2
It's very good app but in logging it is something little bit of problem but it is fine,2
Please put back the original icon for notifications (the round W) as after the recent update it is using the same one as normal Facebook and it can be difficult to tell the two apart at a glance.,2
"Surprisingly good. Much better than using regular fb for work-related stuff: important posts don't get buried because everyone hits ""like"" on a pic of someone's baby, but seem to pretty much remain organized by time/date. Users who struggle with new apps but who already use Facebook will probably find the interface fairly intuitive. One drawback: app sometimes randomly decides not to send notifs for long periods of time. This could be due to my own device settings, though, so no stars deducted.",2
Great for catching up with the family,2
Wowww,2
It's a very good app!! But sometimes it makes me irritated because of the network problems and some similar problems! But it's good,1
I am having to use webex and it's cool and all it's just no one can hardly hear me I have to speak louder and all up on the microphone. What is wrong with my audio.,0
Good luck with your best friends,2
This is not worth at all better you should close this . Or improve it evreytime when I take class or any meeting it hangs my device I hate this I I can't even take my class properly and also there is no filter even I have updated this .I have a really bad experience 🙁👎 this is discuting 🙏😔,0
My all problems are solved . It is good app.,2
"Very poor user experience. No 'Settings' option. Call starts directly with Video enabled (even if you don't want it to). Hangs randomly in the middle of calls, with no 'Menu' as such to navigate to. No option to see who are the other participants in the call. Use it only because my organization has purchased a long term contract. DESPERATELY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT!",0
nice,2
"Flawless, easy to enter and exit meetings with no problems.",2
There is no change background there should be like a piramid button on our screen I can't see it. That is the problem.,2
Awesome,2
It's okay but when I click assignments It's taking a while to open and when I'm on class then im turning on my camera I can't open it and when they share screen It's black sometimes (idk why does it look like it but I got fast int) I'm only opening 1 app but it's still lagging so yeah. I'm giving it 3/5,1
Ver bad because notification of upadte pops up everything when joining meetings and then will not able to to join meetings,0
Too much audio problems after update plz resolve it i am a student and i am studying on it and audio disconnects everytime for some reason Plz resolve it,1
"Very useful app. If you could make the intensity/volume of sound for hands free a little higher (like that of youtube and spotify), that would be great.",2
"Not good now because it keeps going back to the Sign In stage and it tells me that my password is incorrect, but it isn't! This is now the THRID time I have to reinstall this app! Three STARS FOR THIS APP.",1
Bad,0
"I am awaiting for license (paid over week ago), and despite it is paid, I may not login to support page, noone answer me at eny of their contacts 8e-mail, live chat, facebook pages). Worst communication ever, they do not care about customers at all.",0
"No audio, i cant hear from seminar. Tried various device",0
Its good. But some times on laptop or desktop for one to one meeting it does not give recording option Which is very useful when we have any training or imp work flow process ongoing on call.,2
"App suddenly crashed i updated it, now push notifications doesn't work, after Live video ends you can't save it to your phone anymore, it freezes a lot. Too many headaches to bother with this app anymore",0
It is nice,2
"Not very helpful. Although this has helped me stay in school and do my work, many times has it kicked me out, overheated my phone, and glitched my teachers' talking to the point where I have not even the slightest clue what they're saying. I'd like it so that if I leave the app it keeps my camera on, sometimes the internet connection is bad so I have to work on my phone that has data, but they still want me to keep my camera on. Captions don't work.",0
Thank you for your service Zoom! Can you please make the virtual background available for all devices? I am using Xiaomi Poco.,1
"Latest version is nice. But instead of clicking ""others"", it would be so nice and easy to just slide down to see all others - All participqnts in same size square box. And we should need to only just click on them to pin. Really wish to change that ""others"" Then this app will be really more easy and good and nice to be used. I use this app frequently and its good.",1
It is a really really good app. I like this too much. And thos app is so help full for doing meetings,2
It is not useless but literally it sucks! First of all the voice of the presenter always has a tendency to crack and the video keeps freezing .It takes a good deal of time to unmute yourself and the video display is indeed not encouraging.Please fix these..........,0
Great program,2

It's a good tool but at times it crashes and takes more time to restart. Crashing in the middle of meeting is embarrassing.,1

Connectivity is poor at best. Can't do two things while on this app and listening to a meeting. Audio becomes incredibly garbled and distorted. Kept dropping me from the call as well. Even Skype is better than this,0
Very nice app for students and teachers,2
"Great online meeting platform. Nearly flawless audio and video sharing, easy to swap between slides and presenter. The only negative I would give it is that I'd like to see the ability to mute a participant on the participant end of the conference, or at least a way to vote on participants that need to be muted that moderators or hosts can act upon, as we had one person with their microphone on who had a lot of background noise and wasn't talking at all (probably accidentally turned on his mic)",2

I have never been able to use this app ever since i downloaded it and is very furstating it keep saying try again,1

"I had a lot of difficult time about using zoom.First, when I share screen, I can't see my camera.Second,other participates can't hear and only see when I share my downloaded vedio.And we can't change our background in Android like PC.",0

"Great on my computer. Unfortunately, doesnt work at all on my Samsung Galaxy S5. Very frustrating especially when coordinating conference calls.   UPDATE 9/15/15: I've since stopped using lifesize on my computer bc it makes my computer crash every time, and it leaves my computer glitchy for weeks after. I only use lifesize on my android tablet. The only place where it works fine, so far...",0
Meet is good / best app 👍👍,0
Problematic. Glitchy,1
This app is great but I have given 4 star because in mobile version there is no option to change background or add virtual background if you add this option in mobile version then I will rate 5 star,2
"Good site & connections, ( unless it is my devices from Ipad/Sams Gal S8; changes looks; the screen needs to accommodate more faces) also i could not get a screenshot to use? Mrs Wiggins",2
"Limited control during meeting. When rotating screen, meeting flips to audio only mode with no way to return to video other than to leave app and reopen",0
So much better than old-school concalls. Works great.,2
Good,2
Excellent experience on a 2 screen device like surface duo,2

"It's really helpful and very Good, it fast quite convenient and also easily accessible",2
"Once there's an update available on playstore, the installed app crashes. I've to uninstall & install the new update. Plus, WHY DO YOU ASK ME TO DO LOGIN PROCEDURE EVERY SINGLE TIME I OPEN THIS DAMN APP??? I've logged in once, closed the app (NOT log out) but still, after 2-3 hours, I've to log in again! Fix yourself",0
I like this app but 1 problem that meet is online. My brother is using 50% of data. And the meet is online. During foundation classes I have finished my 1.50GB so after I am not able to attend my class. So I would suggest that meet should be offline. Else no problem.,1
"Like the other commenters have stated, this app only links you to telephone access.",0
"There are SO MANY bugs and no customer support. I've had the same problems over 3 phones and 3 different versions of Android, so I know it's the software not the phone. This app is BAD and Microsoft doesn't care to improve it. Now it's not refreshing any of my conversations & I got kicked out of a meeting because I tried to look at the chat. Just a real low quality app all around.",0
In this app I can give any filter and any background and place I can share the screen and if there is 45 friends and we are doing a meeting so all those Prince can share the screen together also I am business have and I also love this app I never have any problem in the sky app so very great aap thank,2
"I've only used it once, it seemed to run smoothly however the ability to find rooms/meetings wasn't particularly easy? Maybe by design for security sake? But once in it would have been more useful if there were better descriptions as to control functions and features. After playing with it, it was a ""trial and error"" situation to figure options out. Maybe it's different when using on a desktop vs Mobil like I was on.",1
"There were a number of technical difficulties throughout the 35 minute long meeting. We only had 4 out of the 12 anticipated attendees so I will need to find out if they were having difficulty connecting as I did. Lots of bugs, frequent freezing and rebooting issues. Poor audio. May need to return to another format.",1
The best features and great callexperience,2
Excellent feel more open in my own home,2
Audio not hear with clarity full of disturbances in noises,1
Till now it's good,2
only three because it doesn't join me for more,1
fine not too good,0
Audio doesn't work even on Call in. It's like auto set at 25% of what it should be.,0
"The problems I am facing are as follows.  -The app has changed the microphone preference in a weird way. All the other notifications like WhatsApp/Hangout became inaudible after installing this app. They remain inaudible till I access the Appear.in app preference and select the proper microphone. I need to repeat this activity after sometime, as the app automatically modifies it to the default microphone. Devs, please fix it.  -The recipients hear a feedback due to the microphone settings. The microphone settings is difficult to understand.  -The camera is inverted. Therefore, can not share a text during the meeting.",0
"A TRUE pleasure to see Bible group members and discuss things ""real time"" ~ THANK you! 👏👏👏💕",2
its a little bit boring still like it,2
I would have given it 5 stars but the video is getting very dark from the last month.,0
Great resource but sometimes the organization of posts doesn't make sense. Hard to find posts.,2
"All over it is good app for meeting discussion . But constantly gets hanged, it creates lots of issues as well.",1
Speaker had static and many times totally cut out so nothing could be heard. We could not find a way to ask a question or report a problem. Screen is shades of gray instead of being highly visible. Speaker's content was excellent and I do hope that we will get the slides so that maybe we can piece together what could not be heard.,0
Quality is great. Allows me to have interactions with people that normally I wouldn't be able to have.,2
Love this app,2
Worst app ever. Sometimes the live video is buffering for a long time. So i miss important classes. So I can't study properly.,0
Excellent experience,2
This app super,2

Not perfect as I cannot see seen messages that I sent.,1

Absolutely worst app . Don't install it . It will not work properly .,0
Super,1
Good,2
It's a good app but always want to be updated,0
Excellent,1
"It is a good app.. The reason I have 1 star is because I am a 12 yr old child.. I use it for online classes.. But it shows to update, then only I would be able to join my classes.. But on playstore there is no option to update it... I deleted and installed again. Nothing happened. I missed a lot of studies. Because of this I gave it 1 star otherwise it's a 5 star.. 😡",0
Fine to me,2

Good app for my child it's not dull or get any issues good app so I review it 5 stars thank you for this app,2
"audio and video need connect automatic . not compatible with boost phones or any cheap ""pay as you go"" phones. If service is bad it cuts out a lot. Or if low on battery.",1
Connectivity is poor at best. Can't do two things while on this app and listening to a meeting. Audio becomes incredibly garbled and distorted. Kept dropping me from the call as well. Even Skype is better than this,0
Works great. To agree with another person the messages read dont sync with the desktop.,2
Desktop app getting irritated whenever taking mouse cursor for copying text it simply appears smiley boxes to select. Please correct it.,1
Audio isn't very good.,1
خوب اگه دانلوت بشه,1
There should be time limit of 60 mins,1

Worst app for video conferencing call.,0

mmm,0
"The notification that a video has started is not showing, aftet the video ended those who joined when they comment then only its shows that this person has commented and you missed that class or meeting😡",0
This meet is was very perfect I really like this but some option was not working that background pictures and all not working pls check that,1
"I have veen facing serious issue in the application. I'm able to answer the calls but whenver I open the application it shows login page and when I enter the details, it says cannot login. This is seriously making my mind turned off. Please look into the matter!",1

. M Madd. .mhermm,2
In the most recent update it's not letting me change my pfp (profile photo) at all>:( and it kicks me out of meetings at random and messes up the speaker's audio whenever they're screen sharing,1
"Used to be reliable in previous versions but now hangs in splash screen on Android 8 device, so I'm unable to use it for work meetings and must use voice dial-in instead.",0
Once again an update is required which isn't yet available in the Play Store. That makes the App unusable until the update is made available. This is not acceptable!,0
Good,1
l like the app,1
"Why is it that when I am using my phone for google meet, changing background feature is not available?",1
it's a nice way to talk to my work mates and share things that are happening around us,2
It's not downloading fast it's very slow but it's good,1
So far so good. Wish there was an external dialing feature to make calls too,2
"Its a very good app, but now a days audio is not connecting properly. My phone's microphone is not connecting but it is showing connected. But other applications which are using microphone is perfectly alright. I am facing this problem and it is being a problem to join meetings",0
"Not allowing me to skip the ""invite 2 people"". Even after putting in 2 mail ids its not letting me through. Did all this while creating account, why is it asking again?",0
It was perfect fine at the start but after some days it started to hang and didnt work properly,1
"Really like the app, the calls are not as good as a phone call, but overall it works.",2

Okay,1
This app is so useful for all students. It is easy to use for all kind of students.,2
I have deducted one star because when I connect with a wireless headset It decreases the speed of my wifi,2
I normally could have a 12 people or more on the conference call now it's only 7 people can get on?,1
"My school is using this app for online classes. This is a great app but due to the new updates it has became very slow and always lagging. And also there should be an option for ""screen share with audio"" in mobile.",1
Was working fine till start of this month. I don't know what went wrong but there was sync issue and also I was not receiving notifications of calls n stuff .The App's gone mad it seems. It logins with my previous email address and there is NO OPTION TO GO BACK AND CHANGE IT. I JUST HAD TO UNINSTALL IT I HOPE IT WORKS NOW. what a waste of time! Update - Installing it again fixed the problem 🫂,1
There was a lot of static and the call dropped. Took two times before getting in.,2
Still understanding it,2
App is good but you should add Marathi language for better understanding of this Video conferancing app,0
Doesn't use too much bandwidth,2
"Decent. I'm able to see slides and hear presenter just fine. However, I am not able to use the tools (such as raise hand, add an arrow, etc) like you can with browser version.",1
Good,2
Lots of trouble with screen share when using Bluebean Revu. This is important for the construction industry.,0
Excellent.Just a few occasions of audio and video sticking,2

This is very nice app ...I liked it n also it is very helpfull ...,1

How do you set up or learn more about this if your company hasn't already jumped on board?,1
After your help also it's not connecting to Google classroom in my I KALL mobile please solve this issue,1
I am not able to see all the students on the screen (on my tablet). There is no change layout option (when it comes to mobiles or tablets) and also no recording option. Kindly do the needful and add these things to make it a surperb app.,1
The trainers sound kept cutting out but Otherwise good.,1
Improve the audio video more please,1
It is a very nice app for doing online classes. And comfortable,1
It's a very amazing app,2
I have dance class in this app and I have been using it for 1 year but I have not had any problem yet.,2
God job,2
Please make x86_64 version for chromebooks. The Chat window and participant window should be optimised for larger window.,1
The app consumes too much of Internet Struck in middle,1
"Crashes, doesn't load. Freezes when I go to send messages. Doesn't open messenger",0
If I pin someone while the class the screen keeps blurred... This is the only issue Others worked well with me,1
This app is using much data according to other all app so i request this app to use less data nd all should have virtual background in zoom,0
This is a good app but u can add a thing that only meeting host can make any one present their screen si teacher would know what the students are doing during online classes any way this is a very good app,2
"App is awful. No usability. Doesn't work without WiFi. Cannot connect to 
meetings in 90% of the cases I have to retry multiple times.",0
It s not working mobile network.. only working wifi wats problem,1
Terrible App can't even connect to a call for almost 3 months now,0
I want my workplace from Facebook rate this apple,2
"Android app has such limited settings, especially can't change who's video I'm seeing at what time. Video switching from person to person at even the slightest sound. Video cut out for everyone halfway through call and wouldn't come back. On my laptop, the microphone would not work with the meeting despite working with other software under identical conditions. Overall was a pretty terrible experience.",0
Yeah,0
Brilliant tool for university work.,2
It is very great app,2

"This app is performing well. But the problem is that I can't change my layout, background, or anything else and also I couldn't present properly, when I try to present my video goes off and nobody could see my presentation .

There isna 🐞🐞 Whenever user is updating the app and entering the details it's taking too much time and we have to uninstall and install again this way currently we have workaround,1
Working very well to provide a combination of meeting and communication functions. When I briefly had multiple 365 accounts for clients it was a pain to switch between them. Fix that for 5 stars.,2
I lost audio connection couldn't get a connection back from Webex. I had Video with no motion. I had to connect by phone. Webex meeting was lost.,1

I like uber conference but whenever I complete the URL to join another call it doesn't work. It says it is an invalid user but it is a valid user. =_= aghhh,0
It was great,2
Good idea but poor execution.,0
GoToRoom is extremely user friendly! Great for my business and for my family too!,2
"Easy to use, clear sound and voice",2
"Overall this is a decent mobile version of teams. My biggest gripe is the buggy handing of multiple accounts. After a fresh install my two teams identities work well and I can receive messages and calls from either. However, eventually Teams loses its mind and presents the authentication prompt for one identity but with the other identity's user id. After going through many uninstall and reinstall cycles I have given up and I am stuck carrying two phones.",1

So so,1
Very fluid back and forth conversation with very little disconnect or break in speech.,2
This app is better for Audio but some what distrubance s in video quality.,2
The audio is delayed,1
I love this app really good and so much useful now i can listen my class properly😎🤙🏾. but the reason why i give 3 stars is everyone in my meeting is changing backgrounds and keeping effects but i alone can not change my background or keep effects😭👎🏾they told update your google meet but it is already on update but my effects and background is not coming for me alone😭👎🏾.,1
"Sometimes the audio and video glitch out. Typically, however, as long as you (and the others in the meeting) have a good internet connection all is well.",2
Gy.,2
It is good but the background didn't work in my phone. Why it is brand new and has new model . Why. Why. Why.,1
I think that App Provides comfort Zone for Entrepreneurs for Dealing throughout the World. And Voice and video Quality is bettet but Every thing is not Perfect should Work More,2
Very slow to connect the audio,1
Takes the pain out of conference calls. Great features. I wish sharing docs was integrated within app but hopefully that will come. Third party ways to store docs now isn't seamless or as polished as you might expect from how well rest of the app is designed.,2
Best,1
Inconsistent notifications when someone messages or calls. Often it won't notify if someone messages me directly or calls. Also have issues when using Bluetooth.,0
Great app for personal and work file and chat meetings and it just works.,2

Very worst app beacause it audio is not can not see clear,0
"This is the absolute worst meeting/chat app I have ever used. There are NO mic or camera controls. You cannot see the status of your mic/camera. EVERY app shows your mic/camera controls even if you do no have the option in the meting to use them. I have used Ventrilo, Discord, Facebook/Messenger, Skype, MSN, even AIM. NOTHING is as clunky and poorly designed as Zoom. I would love to give this 0 stars. Neither Android app nor Windows program have indicators for the status of your mic or speaker. I recommend literally any and every other option that is not Zoom. I hate it.",0

Good but l can't enable or disable original sound like l used to do before,1
Its great but when i use this on phone and turn the speaker to phone my phone turns on and off,2
Using this app is an exercise in futility. Crashes consistently. Login issues are a reoccurring feature. Notifications are buggy as well.,0
Very annoying app. Every few days I need to go thru the full login process with 2FA even tho I haven't rebooted the phone or logged out of the app. Calls ring on phone even tho I am clearly active on computer.,0

"Being in the MS ecosystem, MS Teams has been invaluable during this past year and a half. One star deduction for an issue regarding the keyboard layout on my phone.

Excellent app,2
Google meet is much better than zoom my experience with it is actually very good,2
"The older version of google meet was easy to use...Because...While we receiving text from chatbox we need to click menu and go to chatbox...But the older version was quite simple, we are supposed to just swipe for chatbox...It helps!",0

"Clumsy and buggy app. There's no simple ""on/off"" switch other than logging out and logging in. Floating controls are laggy and result in people asking you to unmute when you're already trying to. Landscape mode and screen mirroring only partially works. Some views switch to portrait mode. Some controls, like audio mode, don't work reliably in landscape mode. Presentations viewied in this app are limited to about 1080p resolution regardless of the screen.",0

It requires microphone permission to hear audio. Not working at low network. in online class teachers will use their board to teach but this thing make board blur automatically. This is ridiculous. Audio quality is very poor even if I have full and clear network. Size of the app also double when compared to Google meet. Totally bad experience 😡😶 I am giving 1 star bcs we can't write review without giving star. I request Google to allow writing review without giving any stars.,0
Some of the quality of the audio could have been better but it's understandable considering that there may have been background noise.,2

No fault likely to your app. Cell phones get interference that made much of the content intermittent.,1

"Works great on my Samsung Galaxy S4 mini. You can see why professional Video Conferencing offerings that have been created by experienced teams are much better than the cheap & free stuff aimed at the consumer. A few bugs (not exactly a rarity) but with fixes & updates every 3 weeks at least (quite a rarity!), that's not exactly a problem! Connects very well with our boardroom Icon system.",2
Good but not so better,2
This app has alot of problems first they say failed to join meeting. Second you cannot join the meeting with this account. Third It needs alot of internet and my internet is very fast. Fourth it needs alot of time to install.I do not recommend it to you. I install it becuase I do online classes on meet. But it is good,0
great call app,2
It's one of the best app for meetings and calls but still it does not have many important features such as Picture in picture (PIP) for moblie. Pls add PIP ASAP,2
Easy to use connects to Google calendar,2
Not showing notifications..... Well. It's not fine,1
Thats a very good app,2
If you can't allow Android users to join existing meetings then don't provide an Android app at all.,0

Working too slow,0
overall experience I guess it's pretty good but there are people's about 15 people in this chat room for waiting for it and a few of them I set have said they've been waiting for an hour and a half to no avail and everyone seems to be having more or less the same issues that they can't get onto their laptop for one reason or another so I guess the situation now is to make a phone call I hope every this helps or whatever they could get resolved before it cuts before it shuts off and be nice to sa,1

"Hi, This is more of technical question; here goes: the Webex application for Android seems to have a bug for audio. I connect to my Bluetooth speaker although I can only listen when I ""Search for video"" and sound comes from the Bluetooth speaker. When the search comes up empty, the sound cuts out; so, I search again, and there's my audio. If I do anything else, like chat, there's no sound. The little speaker on my tablet isn't loud enough so I need the speaker. Thank you.",1
It is best app to take online classes. But it take very much data .,1
"I never liked the idea of splitting Hangouts into two different apps for video and chat. This is an app that is alright for video chat but it's a shame that we have to set up a meeting and we can't ""ring"" other people we want to video chat with anymore. Since I like an app that does both video and chat, and since Meet and Chat are integrated into Gmail now, I'm just going use the Gmail app for both. Now I just have to help everyone in my family transfer over from Hangouts.",1
Not a great UI,1
Try,1
It's a good app for meeting but 1 star 🌟 reduced because like I am a student so I take online classes ..And some students who are presenters can remove you and mute you.... 🔇 But your organizer can make them attendees and then they can't do these things..... But I'll suggest you this app...,2

Worst and fraud apk dont install in your phone it will harm your device,0
Good,2
Aap is so nice but the problem is i can't change my background there was no background button but in my class some children change there background .,2
This app is very nice,2
Works but sound very low. I met with my team and the connection and speed was excellent. The sound was very low and I could barely hear everyone. I had to turn off video and hold the phone right next to my ear to hear anyone speaking. Otherwise works as intended.,1

"We are trialling Shifts in the Teams app. I have loaded all the shifts for this week in our shared group and shared the roster to everyone. However, I am unable to view the roster on my mobile app. I had a notice that a schedule was shared, however when I go into Shifts there is nothing. Just a notice that says to go on the desktop to create a shift. I'm not sure if I have done something wrong or something f there is something wrong with the app.",1
"It is not full screen in phone.. can't see the slides fully, old version was better.",0
"I am unable to update the status from this latest Android version released on Nov 8. I tap on the status but it does not give me the usual status option to allow me to change. I tried signing out of the app, cleared data and cache and also uninstalled and reinstalled 5 times and still the same problem. I can change the status from Teams on my PC but status is not changing on the Android app. I even make sure I signed out from both windows version too before I reinstalled the Android app.",0

"Good. However I seem to have an issue with my computer cutting off and restarting whilst I am on Teams calls. Our IT department are looking into the root cause. initially we thought it was caused by Bluetooth headphones however having changed headset the problem still comes up. Only ever happens when I'm using Teams. Aside from this issue, the app is very useful for working with my internal team and external clients. In particular the share screen function.",2
Good,2
Amazing,2

Works as good on mobile as on PC. Can even do conf calls in car via Bluetooth.,2
No so good,1
Ok,1
This app is consuming more data compared to other video meeting apps. My daily data is getting consumed for 2hrs session itself.,0
cannot set background and add image on background on android,0
There is lot of echo for others during meet call and there is no red dot showing during call so I can't troubleshoot also. What to do?,1
Is a good app but some time I cannot hear others voice nor the video properly .,1
"Garbage. Puts you in "" Driving Mode"" where can't watch, talk or even listen to the meeting. Let me worry about my own driving, backseat driver.",0
You're better off just taking your laptop with you. This app is garbage. I could only see a few people on the screen and the few people I was allowed to see were not the active speakers in the meeting. There are very few preferences to select from in this app and the UI needs a lot of work. If mobile meetings are your only choice I would have to suggest finding a different system altogether.,0
"It's very boring... I am only left with old backgrounds after update, but every body has access to new backgrounds. My earlier review was 2 but now it's 1.... Sorry Google, can't help.",0
Worked well but huge battery drain compared to other apps like zoom webex and teams,1
"I am unable to reduce the volume... It is automatic and fixed. Volume is same for earphones as well as speaker mode, which is very annoying and disturbing",0
In this app the more network is needed.i think it should be devlopded.😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😒😒😒very very very garbage app my class is going on and the meeting Is over. Because of this app and the power is cut off then immediately the meeting would be end I think not just updating the screen is not enough just change the setting also that it will not need so much network,0
Half way thru the interview. The chat room.lagged and frozen And the sound was.disconnected,0
Sound quality is not good. Sometimes disturbances in video,1
Good..,2
How can I put filter on my phone?,1
"It does not let you put a background on specific devices, So please fix that, that's why I gave 4 stars",2
Very Good App,2
I have never used visual conferencing and your app was easy to use. Thank you.,2
Why I can't change my background but my friend's can change it,0
Happy to use,2
I'm getting trouble opening any meeting. I've even tried to restart my phone and reinstall the app after uninstalling to make the trouble go away.,0
"It's Easy enough to Figure out what to do&/or how to use this app for people like myself whom are Technology Challenged or Internet Applications Deficient....How to Use Apps for DUMMIES is not needed here, you'll easily be able to figure your way thru Zoom cloud with no problem at all,in my opinion.Im taking my classes via Zoom&I love that I'm able to do it anywhere,on my phone!It saves me alot of stress not having to worry about finding a ride or wondering if they'll show,or am I arriving late?",2
🤨🤨,1
It will be good if the improve the audio system and add more features.,1
Well this is a very very good communicative meeting app but to make you host or to have contacts you have to PAY THEM👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 Very unsatisfying 😔😔😔😔😔😔😓😓😓😓😓😓,1
"Works for the most part except that meeting invites, and the link provided for them, isn't recognized by the app (or even hyperlinked), so you have to manually copy and paste the entire message into a web browser, trim the ""you've been invited to..."" part off, and THEN you can join the meeting. Pretty inconvenient to say the least",0
In this there is a network problem many time and many time it show the meeting is full and it creates difficulty for me so my humble request please make more comfortable this app so that there is no problem in this and make app larger for many people to join this.,0
"Dialpad Meetings (fka UberConference) is easy to use and effective as a teleconferencing tool. Disappointing that they failed to send UberConference users a notification regarding the changes, both the substantive ones and the surprising decision to ""abandon"" the clever brand name of UberC. Will keep using it and explore its capabilities further but not yet giving up my Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or GoToMeeting accounts.",2
I like it sooo much 😍😍,2
Great,2
Can you please explain why my voice is not coming in meeting while using this app in mobile... I cancelled my meeting because of this,1

Nice UI But some problems i face personally i.e when speaker is saying something then it appears on screen, thats why we faces some difficulty to recognise upper part of slide.

"Can't use it anymore. After install I've entered email but after that there is nothing, just white screen. Unusable! Update, I've managed to install it. It turns out that you can't sign in to this application if you have active ad blocker. Why is that? Second update, The memory optimization in this app is so bad that hurts. It drains complete RAM. I'll most likely uninstall it as soon as I check with my company. Other similar apps like Telegram, Viber etc. works like a charm. Teams is bloatware.",0
This new update is really bad and it's making it complicated to login !!!,0
"This is an horrible app. It is giving me nightmare. I wasted my evening trying to find out how can I join via link in this app. Anroid app doestn pick up appear.in link automaticallly, it always take us to web version and stupid web version doesnt work properly. Horrible horrible and utterly horrible.",0
Suspected security concern and unsure of the additional features at this time,0
Screen has to stay on during the call. Can't join without turning audio on. Chat not allowed from the app. These things make this app nearly worthless. Really wish Skype weren't going away.,0

"App is perfect right now to my needs. 3 stars to get attention that the PC app isn't as good as this one! 1. Unlike this app, the windows app cannot switch accounts from one organization Teams to another's. Must sign out and sign in each time. 2. The special sharing option of ""Windows whiteboard"" is terribly glitchy and guests can't see it. But it works when I open windows whiteboard from the taskbar, then share the window like any window. K thnx bye!",1
Great app very useful,2

"It was the worst video meeting I have ever done!! First, the video from the different screens kept rapidly changing. It made me dizzy.

"Teams is great! The reason why I gave only 3 stars is that it lags a lot and it always shows that there has been a glitch and that they will resolve it soon.. Another issue is that whenever I connect my Bluetooth headphones, the teams automatically disconnects... Other then these issues teams is LIT",1

"Honestly, I am surprised at the low engineering level at Microsoft in general. The way you guys handle accounts is just mind boggling. So many problems with signing into different product, so many levels and you DO NOT have the hang of it. Example: I left my job and my email there was deleted. So if I opened the app, I was prompted to sign in. However, I was somehow just invited into a group call over there. Had to restart my phone to stoo it.",0

Really good app. Sound and Video quality never fails me. A recommendation to the developers at Microsoft. The only time the app gives issues is if someone with an extremely bad internet connection does not mute themselves. This causes everyone's voice's to have low quality instead of only the one user with the poor internet issue.,2

I had to change this to one star since they haven't fixed this yet. It no longer syncs w/the desktop version regarding read status. I have all my convos as read on my computer but the app shows most of them as unread. That needs to be fixed. If I try filtering for unread nothing comes up. I have gone into every convo to mark it as read but there is still a red flag that something is unread. I scroll through every convo and nothing shows as unread so I can't even fix it.

Zoom is the best app for meetings and all.But I didn't give 1 star because virtual background is not in my phone.,2
Very useful app for studing,1
Very helpful for remote communication. User friendly interface.,2

"I had to use this as a way to do an interview for a job opportunity so it was really frustrating when the video kept crashing and I had to reload it every 30-60 seconds(I wish that was an exaggeration...) and the sound was delayed 5-8ish seconds when it would get glitchy. But overall it wasn't as bad as it could have been. It just didn't look very professional for a job I was working really hard to get. Thankfully, Regardless of the issues; I think I stildid get the job though so there's that!",1
It takes many spase after ins taling the app,0
"Great concept of total access to work and business contact. Sharing information, communication, and videos. A must have for any companies.",2
I have to say that over the past 5 years I've noticed a significant improvement in how Microsoft delivers product. Teams is a good example of this. The software is excellent right out of the gate on Android. However given the pandemic Microsoft has really stepped up to the plate releasing features that really improve the work from home experience. Teams is a great product on all their platforms. I love the selection of tools that Microsoft is developing for Android.,2
App needs a lot of work. Crashes a lot. Invite screen unusable. Calls to many participants by default,0

I have just 1 problem... Viewing the presentation and the chat is not possible at the same time... I hope Google will fix that... Everything else with the app is perfect ✌️,2
Can't control the audio volume. Zoom override your device audio settings. Otherwise it is perfect.,2
"The Teams app on the Google Pixel 6 Pro asks me to authenticate every time I open the app and it's getting really annoying. I didn't have these issues on my previous phone, a Google Pixel 2. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app but that didn't seem to help. I use Teams everyday for my job, and I use it on both my phone and computer. It's essential that this tool work properly for me.",2
"Very user friendly, thank you",2
"Getting better all the time. The app seems a bit schizophrenic. You can be in the app and click on a link to another document in teams and it tries to launch the web browser based teams functionality. This type of inconsistent is all over the tool, but it is still on the right track.",2
Log time not shear,0
No other Hand Gestures in phone and Tab,0
It is very easy to take online classes on this app and it is very good app for students as well as teachers,2
Great App. It's very easy to understand and worked perfectly,2

I had to walk her thru my device's operation functions & settings as well as service provider's setting & operating status & still she has no admission of fault! It's your app!

GoToMeeting has a trial version but it's not free for personal use. A paying user can invite a non paying user for virtual meeting but not the other way. You don't pay you don't play.,0

cool,2
Once we got the settings right it worked perfectly. The video was crisp and the audio was clear. I would recommend using earbuds if you're using a smart phone. Go To Meeting allowed me to see my doctor without leaving my house during the covid-19 Stay at Home situation.,2

"The app is good, with exception of the ease to view. Very touchy and takes me different screens and annoying trying to get back to the viewing screen within the meeting. I try to expand it (squeeze fingers together on screen to zoom in) and works, but then very hard to move the screen around without the whole application moving to other functions within the meeting. Overall, easy to maneuver the meeting and crystal-clear voice.",2
This is a best software that used for online classes. But today I saw a bug the is connecting but at the class and the timer is showing 00:00 and mute. I have a good connection and this never happened before so please fix this bug so I can listen online class,1
Average.,1
Wow,2
🧡👍🧡,2
Decent application for meetings and webinars. The main issue that I had problems with is the volume controls. On Android it seemed to alternate between either the phone control or the media control to adjust the volume. In either case it seem to be inconsistent depending on what was happening in the meeting. Other than that everything worked as expected.,2

There was no audio most of the time,1
"The app doesn't seem to properly manage my device's audio controllers. After I do any call on teams, my Bluetooth audio stops working for all apps on my phone and I have to force stop teams to get it to work again. It also seems like my phone still thinks that I'm on a call, because the volume buttons change call volume instead of media volume, even hours after the call has ended (until I force stop teams, then volume buttons go back to normal). I have also had several occasions where I can't join a Teams call at all without rebooting my phone. It just hangs on the connecting screen.",0

I find the app a little aggrevating because there are so many things going on when i get a notification and all i want to see is the messages. you should be able to just look at a simple list of messages that are being notified instead of a pane with part of a cutboff message. I'm off work and open it in case there's an emergency and then it's like ""i bought donuts"" ""thanks"" ""meme"" ""haha"". that list should show immediately insteadbof an empty window with a picture.",0
calling system is just like 5 star but one zoom app named team games gets hanged so I cannot play it,2

There is a problem where when you are in a meeting and want to multi task the app the whole screen becomes blank and unusable please fix it,1
This app is very important me,1
a unique app that can help many people for meeting online,2
Good application,2
"Note, my current device (Nexus 6P) is officially unsupported(yet?) but the issues stated here also plagued my Nexus 5 which was not unsupported.  I've never had issues with the app itself regarding calls, quality, or performance. My main issue is when I'm not using the app. It has a persistent never-ending notification keeping me signed in long after I've ended my call. The app itself has no apparent way to prevent this and the solution I've found is to actually remove it from my recent apps list. This is far from intuitive and not in line with most app standards. The huge flaw is that it consumes battery at an alarming rate. I've had a full charge drop to 50% in 4 hours because I forgot to kill the app. I would like a setting to prevent persistence or some intelligence in the app to background itself properly. I'll gladly adjust my review when that is remedied.",0
"I love the app it is very easy to use, and the quality of its sound is very okay I really like it",2
No commint,2

This is a very good app in the lockdown of 2020 this app helps very easily when i download it first time i dont know how to join or create a meeting but after some time i know every thing like how to use and create a meeting and now its fine and this application help me lot specialy for online classes,2
"Worked ok, didn't want video of me going out, and required permission to turn on and record stills/video, so that worked out ok. Some how to connect audio, thru internet for me, also worked. Takes a while to learn the interface, not that different than Zoom or Jitsi, so figured it out, gave me some tech to do during mostly talking. 20211212 another, this didn't work at all, unuseable, maybe connection date/time, complained on cert, etc",1
It is very bad App doesn't work at phone.,0
Disconnects when I go to other apps unlike the older versions. I cant read my skype messages while meeting is ongoing. Not sure if it is just with the note 5. But all in all it does not allow me to do my work on phone efficiently anymore.,1
"Great service, my congregation and I are very please with UberConference.",2
This is a awesome place for group meeting. And the feature of this app is very easy to use,2
Great App. The black theme is kinda lame though. Add dark blue or a green gradient background. Just some mild color infusion in the theme would be nice. Zoom looks like it's from the 90s.,2

Very nice in everything. Shows the time when the next meeting will happen in calendar. Tells you if the network is slow. We or others can assign us assignments and we can turn or hand in. We can see if people are online , offline , busy , available. Everything about this app is just magnificent.You should download this.",2

Audio not good and video not clear,0
The ability to filter on 'Unread Messages' has been removed on the chat tab. So now my mobile device show 1 unread and the desktop doesn't show that. I use to be able to filter and click each one to clear it. Now on top of the unread marks being broken there is no way to fix. Thanks 🙄,0
"There's always an echo I hear when I talk so we talk on the phone and mute the Webex, and this way there's no echoing when I speak. Where it says ""Tell us more (optional)"" there isn't a place to type it comes back to this area to type. When I first logged on it said ""no future meeting."" My provider calls me on the landline and then we can see each other. Aside from that the app works well.",2

The app is good but I am giving it 3 stars because this app is not good for studying. 1.First thing is that the teachers can't see the student's name. 2.Second thing us that there is no message box for teachers to write notes for students. 3.Third thing is there is no thing for presentation of screen. I think for studying Google meet app is good than Go To meeting.,1

"My experience was good,though have given only three 🌟, the number of people to join the meeting should be recommended. In this meeting I attended we were close to 70+ participants and in various locations, others as far as 50Kms. So issues of controlling the meeting and intermittent internet network, could probably affect quality of deliberation in such a meeting with large number of participants.",1
"I miss the feature to pin yourself in mobile. In mobiles with small screen, 5 people can be shown at a time. Among them, one person cannot be pinned due to a sign that shows how many people are present(the sign covers the three dots present in every person's icon ). Also, I can't minimize the screen as when I choose the minimize button, the screen becomes blank grey. I then have to rejoin by using the red bar in the notification bar. But if I minimize again, same thing happens twice. Again&again",0

It drains battery faster than any other meeting application. I like teams a lot, its a very nice application.",1

I enjoy Teams. It gets hard to track multiple chats with the multiple Teams I'm a part of though. I wish it would default to different tabs or some easier way to toggle.,2

After new update my meeting leaves automatically and there is audio issues when I attend class using data and my audio lags to other people . I hope if u read my comment you'll try to improve this glitch...,1
This app is not detecting my headphones. I have updated it several times hoping for solution still the problem persists. I have purchased a new set of headphones and those are working fine for you tube and other audios/videos but not working for meet.. this app is problematic for audios... Kindly look into it. I have to take regular online classes and this fault is hampering my studies.,1

On the desktop app, I have the option to see at least 12 participants in the same grid view window. Why is it not the same on an Android tablet? It should not be the same as on the phone but adjust according to screen size.",0

The Desktop version of GTM is great but the Android app is rather limited.

"I've used zoom since 2015 when convenience trumped security. It's always been easy to use, much more reliable than competitors WebEx, beehive, Meet, Skype (which was great until we started seeing ads during our meetings, whose idea was that?!)",2
Difficult to log in . Buggy. A,0
Excellent,2
Gooe great,2
Okey,2
Back up and running ok,0
This so much disturbed app it can't sign in my google account showing that password is wrong however I checked it then also it is not signing .,0

I dearly love this app as it helps me to stay in touch with my friends. During this time of CORONAVIRUs ZOOM has been a great help support and comfort to me. I don't know what I would do without it! Thanks so very much!,2

Ok,2
"Sometime the network signal is full, also but zoom is not connecting, it's showing one black screen and at the top connecting symbol is showing 😩",0
"Good, with audio notifications or speach to text option would be 5star",2
Nice for meeting,2
"Zoom is more profitable, expecially in this pandermic time, it has hold many problems for most and we always thanking Jehovah for given that wisdom for those who builed that app for the Univers, Jehovah continuon bless zoom app protect it for us all, in Jesus Christ name Amen.",2
Nice,2

"I like google meet app... but as I am using it in my tablet, there is no option for raise hand... please try to fix it",1
Superb,2
Google meet is good app I have been using this app for years but now there is a problem I can't hear anything in the meeting but if can fix this problem please fix it,1
Excellent,2
I have an error report my camera option is not there for some reason plz fix that overall it's a good app,1
"it will be good , if we can get keyboard and mouse control for mobile",1
"I have been trying to Install the App on my mobile phone over 2weeks now but its just saying ""waiting for download""",0
It's was crystal clear audio session,1
Every week it is asking for the update and once you update it you won't be able to get the message again you need to uninstall it,0
Suddenly we see different layouts and it's disturbing when you are in meeting. Moreover desktop app is crashing down and difficult to attend calls,2
I have a meeting to record and I cannot do it directly from the app. I am using a screen recording app but there is no sound since audio recording is probably not enabled. So could the developers enable the audio recording so I can record my meeting?,0
App refuses to close. Always running. Doesn't remember credentials. Can't full screen presentations or zoom them. This is a half arsed implementation.,0
Very helpful in a visual meeting and clear the audio so nice app...,2
Really frustrated by multiple attempts to enter court hearings on 2 separate occasions months apart. I would not give it one star rating because it is complex to use and doubly unreliable. I didn't get the chance to be offended by ads.,0
Very easy to log into meetings and once you've done few it remembers recent meeting IDs so you dont have to. A bit stressful when I recently forgot my password but was easy enough to resolve in the end.,2
"The audio quality was very good, and i like the layout of the app. I had a problem with my video. Prior to starting my call, my camera preview of what i looked like appeared fine. After starting the meeting, however, my video was black with very little light exposure. I could turn my camera towards the window and see sunlight but all other details were dark and impossible to make out. I would think this were an issue with my camera if not for the fact that the pre-call preview looked fine.",1
"My phone got hang completely on the first time when try to make a call via ""goto meeting"" link.",0
Very nice app for video calling meeting,2
It is good but u want to update more,2
Why it is not able to open any documents 🤬,0
Excellent service,2
Very patchy. It kept having to buffer.,0
Very useful specially this time for business and school,2
"Does not work with BlueTooth and does not show proper names for devices. E.g. hash-names are shown, such as ""7f6c1"", ""3d560"" instead of ""Camera, front"", ""Camera, brack"". No bluetooth headset support, makes it completely useless, for me atleast. Please fix! The service works OK in Google Chrome but is really resource heavy, was hoping for some sort of ""acceleration"" by using the App instead, but it is actually worse than just using a browser.",0
Nice,2
good app,2
This is very good,2
Hello when I get into meet my net slow down to 0.22 mbs and I have a good wifi,0
"This is a good app, but i'd given only 2 ★★ because in the video they are showing that we can change the background but in my phone this option is not coming otherwise good 👍🏻",0
"This app is great 🙂 but...the camera is not really that good ☹️And, I am not eligible to sign in so the app doesn't work that much😭But overall, it is a great app",1
"The app is really nice, still from a while my video is creating a scene, the prblm is that , whenever I switch my audio on for some time it goes all well but then after sometime my meeting get disconnected.... My network also can't be a problem as I have enough of data..",0
Pretty good quality call and audio,2

It's not a good app zoom meeting is better than this but my online school is going on it I am telling teachers and sir take online class on zoom but they are not listening the teachers is saying there is no use because there not educated always internet and audio issue,0
Uber > Skype. That is all.  My favorite online conferencing app comes to Android. Bloody fantastic! Works great on Android. Is absolutely outstanding on the desktop.,2
But it too slow to load apps or download,1
Nice app but it takes more data when I take online class and one more thing is it's only given 40 min to online meeting that's cause some important topic not discussed at that time I think it would be better if it's time period is increase...,1
"This app is great, but whenever I join a meeting it always freezes and I can't touch anything on my screen until I leave the meeting.",1
"Bit prone to crashing my phone when closing long video meetings, and doesn't interact well with the combination of phone lock screen and MS authenticator when a call is ringing. Also accumulates a lot of storage in the phone memory not the SD card. So consideration of the user experience aside, it does the job.",0
"dunno why, I already use GM b4 but why so hard, its been weeks but can't still use this to our online class, I have same account just diff. phone. so frustrating so many questions.",1
"Webex for me is flexible,everytime I attend the meeting it's smooth there no hassle to join in the meeting.thank you webex🙏",2
This is best best opp aap because class is doing very well but sometimes when rain or any other natural condition this is going good not very well so I give 4 star . Hope you download google meet,2
Good app for students but some students use this for fun in classes.,1

Works well for the meetings we have had. Good call quality. Good transitions from Wi-Fi to Cell service and back as I ran around.,2

Very good app you can use it . But plz add new features like we can send message individually to a perticular person like not all the participants can see it so plz add this fear . I will give five 🌟 if you will add this,2
"i can't update it, i can't change my background too",0
"The basic functionality that is the ability to schedule a conference call 
using the app is extremely buggy. There are major bugs in this whole 
application. Whenever you try to set up the conference says it is unable to 
do it, however it still sends out an email saying that the conference is 
scheduled, but when you log back into the app, there is no record of a 
conference in the actual dashboard so there's no way to modify it if the 
time changes without creating a completely new conference. Also when you 
try to add a participant directly to the fields in the app, it says cannot 
create the contact even though all the details of properly typed in. These 
are long-standing problems that need to be addressed, it's a real 
irritation with this app.",0

"It's fine. It's certainly much better now than it used to be. They finally implemented a ""reply to message"" feature, which was sorely needed. But ultimately it's just another one of the multitudes of chat tools that I use, this one specifically for work.",1
