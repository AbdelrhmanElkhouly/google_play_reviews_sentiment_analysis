"Even in my travelling time zoom meetings are helpful, it is clear.",2
Great plateform for conducting meeting. need improvement like some control upfront,2
An excellent application experience. It runs seamlessly in all the fronts. Connectivity is no more an issue. You would always find the operational information before you. Looking forward the similar experience in future as well.,2
"Very Good,But please provide more options Mobile Phone users.Thank You For Taking Feedback, Good Job.",2
I am reinstalling this application can't open the assignments on one go.,0
"Superior, Reliable, Unbeatable, as long as you can read it works every time!",2
The newer the updates get the worst the app is. There is a mobile glitch in assignments that you can't open a pdf file ( I don't know about any other files) I hope this app will improve updates.,0
"This app was easy to use before. But after some days, my camera went blur and sides of the camera went black. So I use uninstall and reinstall it. But nowadays, I restart my tablet, reinstall it for a thousand times but nothing works for fixing this camera. My camera works in other applications well but not in meet.",0

This is so wrost app when I download ü§¨ü§¨ this is automaticially restart download and take my 500 MB of data .,0
I think it was okay but it was hard to hear everyone.it needs to be more controlled when counsel members want to comment on item at hand. Too much feedback noise tonight. Great job Mayor,2
Excellent experience,2
Experience was great. Everything such as sound and video worked very well. I would've liked to test it all just to be sure before joining the actual meeting but turned out a very smooth experience.,2
"Extreme difficulty connecting. Lots of echo. It was our first time using this platform, but compared to others, it was very complicated, not intuitive and required vastly more time to set up.",0
Crashing problems,1
This app is quite good and I have been using for the past couple of years but off late it is not allowing me to share youtube video with my students. It is really giving a lot of trouble right now. Please do something and fix the problem.,0

Thankyou,0
Love it,2
Poor options. 1.No white board option ( where lecturer can explain his/her work by writing). 2. Also it would helpful if there is options like subtitles/captions for English language. 3. There must be an files section where i can see recordings of the meeting. 4. No option to delete message when I accidentally sent,0
So far so good. There was a glitch were I wasn't able to hear the person speaking even though their screen had the green outline signaling that they were indeed speaking and I'm unsure if it was my internet or the zoom app that's why I'm rating with for stars.,2
"Wow zoom meetings is great try to use it i pledge to you that you won't regret using this app,you will be able to communicate with other people from far places without any problems try it you will see for your self",2

Good tool,2
If i join in the meet i can't hear the voice of others and can't see the screen presenting by others because of it i can't attend my class and also it was automatically exiting from the class,0
"Very easy to use, nicely done",2
Very worest audio and strucking in between.,0
"Zoom is very functional and largely intuitive, and it will be cool when they figure out how to deal with more than one person speaking at the same time.",2
"Many issues. 1. When network is switched, audio reconnection takes little time, 2. When waiting for the organizer, and the orginiser starts the meeting, the auto joining not happening (on Poco F1), 3. Sometimes issue #1 occurs in happy scenario of issue #2(i.e., joined, but audio not connected).",1

"Led light notifications don't appear on Samsung. They work perfectly for *every* app, including trash mobile games, but Microsoft once again wrote something special.

"I have been using Go-to meeting for Dr's appointments. I find the service to be very easy to use and navigate. The only downside is the lag in voices, which is not a big issue. Thank you for the great service and platform.",2

I have Teams on my phone and laptop for work. If I try to have a conversation on the phone app then the other person's responses don't show up unless I leave the chat and come back in. Also it has started to constantly request me to login again whenever the app opens. The app is really starting to annoy me.,0

"This has to be the worst video conferencing program ever. Trying to log in. The program goes to a looping system which continuously asks for log in information or reset password. This is a complete waste of an app. If I could convince my clients to use something different I would, unfortunately Microsoft was able to convince them that other (and better) apps have security issues which are completely not true today. Typical Microsoft style, release a program...work out the bugs later...",0

"Tried on a android phone, could not send video, had alot of trouble with audio",1
I hope you can add background.,1
Zoom please fix the whiteboard. I'm not able to draw anymore. Also if i play music on a speaker and speak at the same time it cuts the music out weirdly. This is not a problem with my phone because for example on Facebook live i CAN speak and have music playing at the same time.,0
"It works. No issues on my PC or Android phone, or just plain calling in.",2

"Annoying bleeps when people enter and leave the meeting, which can happen several times on unstable internet connection.",0
Just installed the app and I haven't used it much.,2
There is no virtual background in my app while others have. Please fix this for me and I¬¥ll rate 5 stars for you.,0
"I'm leaving a middling review because this app nags you to leave reviews periodically. So, -1 point for the aggressive review farming. Inferior to slack for chat and superior to zoom for video conferences. My biggest problem with this app is the inability to search and find a conversation in context. You can search, but you can't go to a chat at the line of the search result and see the surrounding conversation. This is something that should just work in a chat app. -1 for that.",1
Great app great idea,2
I hate this but sometimes good. It is sticking so much not working also I have to delete and re download,0
Marvellous! I missed it,2
"Very user-friendly system. Allows for phone calls, team meetings and the ability to record.",2
It's very good app but in logging it is something little bit of problem but it is fine,2
Please put back the original icon for notifications (the round W) as after the recent update it is using the same one as normal Facebook and it can be difficult to tell the two apart at a glance.,2
"Surprisingly good. Much better than using regular fb for work-related stuff: important posts don't get buried because everyone hits ""like"" on a pic of someone's baby, but seem to pretty much remain organized by time/date. Users who struggle with new apps but who already use Facebook will probably find the interface fairly intuitive. One drawback: app sometimes randomly decides not to send notifs for long periods of time. This could be due to my own device settings, though, so no stars deducted.",2
Great for catching up with the family,2
Wowww,2
It's a very good app!! But sometimes it makes me irritated because of the network problems and some similar problems! But it's good,1
I am having to use webex and it's cool and all it's just no one can hardly hear me I have to speak louder and all up on the microphone. What is wrong with my audio.,0

My all problems are solved . It is good app.,2
"Very poor user experience. No 'Settings' option. Call starts directly with Video enabled (even if you don't want it to). Hangs randomly in the middle of calls, with no 'Menu' as such to navigate to. No option to see who are the other participants in the call. Use it only because my organization has purchased a long term contract. DESPERATELY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT!",0
nice,2
"Flawless, easy to enter and exit meetings with no problems.",2
There is no change background there should be like a piramid button on our screen I can't see it. That is the problem.,2
Awesome,2
It's okay but when I click assignments It's taking a while to open and when I'm on class then im turning on my camera I can't open it and when they share screen It's black sometimes (idk why does it look like it but I got fast int) I'm only opening 1 app but it's still lagging so yeah. I'm giving it 3/5,1

Too much audio problems after update plz resolve it i am a student and i am studying on it and audio disconnects everytime for some reason Plz resolve it,1
"Very useful app. If you could make the intensity/volume of sound for hands free a little higher (like that of youtube and spotify), that would be great.",2
"Not good now because it keeps going back to the Sign In stage and it tells me that my password is incorrect, but it isn't! This is now the THRID time I have to reinstall this app! Three STARS FOR THIS APP.",1
Bad,0
"I am awaiting for license (paid over week ago), and despite it is paid, I may not login to support page, noone answer me at eny of their contacts 8e-mail, live chat, facebook pages). Worst communication ever, they do not care about customers at all.",0
"No audio, i cant hear from seminar. Tried various device",0
Its good. But some times on laptop or desktop for one to one meeting it does not give recording option Which is very useful when we have any training or imp work flow process ongoing on call.,2
"App suddenly crashed i updated it, now push notifications doesn't work, after Live video ends you can't save it to your phone anymore, it freezes a lot. Too many headaches to bother with this app anymore",0
It is nice,2
"Not very helpful. Although this has helped me stay in school and do my work, many times has it kicked me out, overheated my phone, and glitched my teachers' talking to the point where I have not even the slightest clue what they're saying. I'd like it so that if I leave the app it keeps my camera on, sometimes the internet connection is bad so I have to work on my phone that has data, but they still want me to keep my camera on. Captions don't work.",0
Thank you for your service Zoom! Can you please make the virtual background available for all devices? I am using Xiaomi Poco.,1
"Latest version is nice. But instead of clicking ""others"", it would be so nice and easy to just slide down to see all others - All participqnts in same size square box. And we should need to only just click on them to pin. Really wish to change that ""others"" Then this app will be really more easy and good and nice to be used. I use this app frequently and its good.",1
It is a really really good app. I like this too much. And thos app is so help full for doing meetings,2
It is not useless but literally it sucks! First of all the voice of the presenter always has a tendency to crack and the video keeps freezing .It takes a good deal of time to unmute yourself and the video display is indeed not encouraging.Please fix these..........,0
Great program,2

Connectivity is poor at best. Can't do two things while on this app and listening to a meeting. Audio becomes incredibly garbled and distorted. Kept dropping me from the call as well. Even Skype is better than this,0
Very nice app for students and teachers,2
"Great online meeting platform. Nearly flawless audio and video sharing, easy to swap between slides and presenter. The only negative I would give it is that I'd like to see the ability to mute a participant on the participant end of the conference, or at least a way to vote on participants that need to be muted that moderators or hosts can act upon, as we had one person with their microphone on who had a lot of background noise and wasn't talking at all (probably accidentally turned on his mic)",2

However, the app is NOT fully optimized for tablets, only phones. Why they wouldn't optimize it for tablets makes no sense. Otherwise the app works fine.

Meet is good / best app üëçüëç,0

"Once there's an update available on playstore, the installed app crashes. I've to uninstall & install the new update.

I like this app but 1 problem that meet is online. My brother is using 50% of data. And the meet is online. During foundation classes I have finished my 1.50GB so after I am not able to attend my class. So I would suggest that meet should be offline. Else no problem.,1

"There are SO MANY bugs and no customer support. I've had the same problems over 3 phones and 3 different versions of Android, so I know it's the software not the phone. This app is BAD and Microsoft doesn't care to improve it. Now it's not refreshing any of my conversations & I got kicked out of a meeting because I tried to look at the chat. Just a real low quality app all around.",0
In this app I can give any filter and any background and place I can share the screen and if there is 45 friends and we are doing a meeting so all those Prince can share the screen together also I am business have and I also love this app I never have any problem in the sky app so very great aap thank,2
"I've only used it once, it seemed to run smoothly however the ability to find rooms/meetings wasn't particularly easy? Maybe by design for security sake? But once in it would have been more useful if there were better descriptions as to control functions and features. After playing with it, it was a ""trial and error"" situation to figure options out. Maybe it's different when using on a desktop vs Mobil like I was on.",1
"There were a number of technical difficulties throughout the 35 minute long meeting. We only had 4 out of the 12 anticipated attendees so I will need to find out if they were having difficulty connecting as I did. Lots of bugs, frequent freezing and rebooting issues. Poor audio.

All the other notifications like WhatsApp/Hangout became inaudible after installing this app. They remain inaudible till I access the Appear.in app preference and select the proper microphone. I need to repeat this activity after sometime, as the app automatically modifies it to the default microphone. Devs, please fix it.  -The recipients hear a feedback due to the microphone settings. The microphone settings is difficult to understand.  -The camera is inverted. Therefore, can not share a text during the meeting.",0

"All over it is good app for meeting discussion . But constantly gets hanged, it creates lots of issues as well.",1
Speaker had static and many times totally cut out so nothing could be heard. We could not find a way to ask a question or report a problem. Screen is shades of gray instead of being highly visible. Speaker's content was excellent and I do hope that we will get the slides so that maybe we can piece together what could not be heard.,0
Quality is great. Allows me to have interactions with people that normally I wouldn't be able to have.,2

Connectivity is poor at best. Can't do two things while on this app and listening to a meeting. Audio becomes incredibly garbled and distorted. Kept dropping me from the call as well. Even Skype is better than this,0

"Used to be reliable in previous versions but now hangs in splash screen on Android 8 device, so I'm unable to use it for work meetings and must use voice dial-in instead.",0
Once again an update is required which isn't yet available in the Play Store. That makes the App unusable until the update is made available. This is not acceptable!,0

This is a good app but u can add a thing that only meeting host can make any one present their screen si teacher would know what the students are doing during online classes any way this is a very good app,2

Blah. I hope the security is good because that would be the only thing this has going for it compared to it's competitors. Google meet and zoom are both easier to use than this,0
Easily crash when use with ipad,1
"There's no audio settings.. my audiences in meeting cannot catch up with what i was saying. other apps are okay, loud and clear so I'm hoping Google meet could improve on that part",0
"It's too bad, there is no sound, the video is also not good",0
"Easy to use, I just click on the email and Gotometting pops up and I wait for my therapist to start the meeting then I click mic, video, and share video. Done!",2
Very easy to set up and use.,2
Good,1

"This is good app. But I cannot change background before joining, after joining class.",0
"Sound nor clear, registration process is tedious.",1
"When my classes are over, it keeps on annoying me it wants 5-rate always Monday to Friday, Im tired of that rating but when I rate it 5 and another day has come, it wants another rate. Pls fix it",0
This app is nice üëç to metting and I really like it .,0
This app is really a nice plot for meetings and family meetings you can try it his app easily very nice,0
Nice. But sometimes network issue has occurred many times,1
The instructions as participant were not clear.,1
Video clarity is not good even high speed internet...,0
The audio doesn't working,0
Well connected,2
I wish it wasn't so big for a work Facebook. Still a great app for organizations that subscribe to it!,2
Once I gained access to my meeting reception was a lil spotty for a few minutes. But overall I think it very user friendly I had no trouble using the app.,2
I love the live interaction that comes with using this app.,2
This app is very helpful to us but some problem are their will be many people are present in the meeting but in this app only 100 people are join at a time,1
I cant even join in the meeting because of the update issue,0
I have great experience with teams,2
"Great app, simple to use, easy to regulate.",2
"The webseminar was very informative, positive, and easy-to-follow. I learned a lot today and I hope to see the next one.",2
Great,2
Zoom has worked well however last meeting I couldn't locate participants or other tools. I am a participant. I hope it is better next time.,2
Great service ... great app ... I can't believe it's FREE!,2
Hey guys. I love the app & gave 3 star rating only to ask you to clear all the unnessary bugs. Good app but not the best. It hangs in between & logs out itself. Not Bad or Not Good. Thank you. CLEAR THE BUGS AS SOON AS POSSIBILE !,1

"Simple chaos. It was not intuitive or easy to install, connect and use this program. Understand I have to use my phone mostly due to travel, but you have to prep and learn before using this option. Not as simple as Zoom, but not as complex as teams or meet.",1
Worst and fraud apk dont install in your phone it will harm your device,0
Good,2
Aap is so nice but the problem is i can't change my background there was no background button but in my class some children change there background .,2
This app is very nice,2
Works but sound very low. I met with my team and the connection and speed was excellent. The sound was very low and I could barely hear everyone. I had to turn off video and hold the phone right next to my ear to hear anyone speaking. Otherwise works as intended.,1

However, I am unable to view the roster on my mobile app. I had a notice that a schedule was shared, however when I go into Shifts there is nothing. Just a notice that says to go on the desktop to create a shift. I'm not sure if I have done something wrong or something f there is something wrong with the app.",1
"It is not full screen in phone.. can't see the slides fully, old version was better.",0
"I am unable to update the status from this latest Android version released on Nov 8. I tap on the status but it does not give me the usual status option to allow me to change. I tried signing out of the app, cleared data and cache and also uninstalled and reinstalled 5 times and still the same problem. I can change the status from Teams on my PC but status is not changing on the Android app. I even make sure I signed out from both windows version too before I reinstalled the Android app.",0
Moulamoulam,2
"UI is a mess. I can't tell if it supports full screen and audio or not. There was no indication that there wasn't any audio, so i was clicking around, trying to make sense of the UI before finally giving up and dialing in.",0
I can hear the next person clear thanks....though I think there is still a room for improvement,1
It indicates that the internet connection is connecting but could hear the conversation,1
"You should show notifications if yhere is a meeting that has started, there is a BUG where when a person shared a screen, yhe screen became black and the image is compress in the screen.",1
Everything is good but please remove who's talking notification when meeting is going on because it cover upper portion of screen when view at portrait mode ...,0
New trying to learn the system..,0
Waste app,0
"Good. However I seem to have an issue with my computer cutting off and restarting whilst I am on Teams calls. Our IT department are looking into the root cause. initially we thought it was caused by Bluetooth headphones however having changed headset the problem still comes up. Only ever happens when I'm using Teams. Aside from this issue, the app is very useful for working with my internal team and external clients. In particular the share screen function.",2
Good,2
Amazing,2
Face book homer lennon,1
Works as good on mobile as on PC. Can even do conf calls in car via Bluetooth.,2
No so good,1
Ok,1
This app is consuming more data compared to other video meeting apps. My daily data is getting consumed for 2hrs session itself.,0
cannot set background and add image on background on android,0
There is lot of echo for others during meet call and there is no red dot showing during call so I can't troubleshoot also. What to do?,1
Is a good app but some time I cannot hear others voice nor the video properly .,1
"Garbage. Puts you in "" Driving Mode"" where can't watch, talk or even listen to the meeting. Let me worry about my own driving, backseat driver.",0
You're better off just taking your laptop with you. This app is garbage. I could only see a few people on the screen and the few people I was allowed to see were not the active speakers in the meeting. There are very few preferences to select from in this app and the UI needs a lot of work. If mobile meetings are your only choice I would have to suggest finding a different system altogether.,0
"It's very boring... I am only left with old backgrounds after update, but every body has access to new backgrounds. My earlier review was 2 but now it's 1.... Sorry Google, can't help.",0
Worked well but huge battery drain compared to other apps like zoom webex and teams,1
"I am unable to reduce the volume... It is automatic and fixed. Volume is same for earphones as well as speaker mode, which is very annoying and disturbing",0
In this app the more network is needed.i think it should be devlopded.üòïüòïüòïüòïüòïüòïüòïüòïüòíüòíüòívery very very garbage app my class is going on and the meeting Is over. Because of this app and the power is cut off then immediately the meeting would be end I think not just updating the screen is not enough just change the setting also that it will not need so much network,0
Half way thru the interview. The chat room.lagged and frozen And the sound was.disconnected,0
Sound quality is not good. Sometimes disturbances in video,1
Good..,2
How can I put filter on my phone?,1
"It does not let you put a background on specific devices, So please fix that, that's why I gave 4 stars",2
Very Good App,2
I have never used visual conferencing and your app was easy to use. Thank you.,2
Why I can't change my background but my friend's can change it,0
Happy to use,2
I'm getting trouble opening any meeting. I've even tried to restart my phone and reinstall the app after uninstalling to make the trouble go away.,0
"It's Easy enough to Figure out what to do&/or how to use this app for people like myself whom are Technology Challenged or Internet Applications Deficient....How to Use Apps for DUMMIES is not needed here, you'll easily be able to figure your way thru Zoom cloud with no problem at all,in my opinion.Im taking my classes via Zoom&I love that I'm able to do it anywhere,on my phone!It saves me alot of stress not having to worry about finding a ride or wondering if they'll show,or am I arriving late?",2
ü§®ü§®,1
It will be good if the improve the audio system and add more features.,1
Well this is a very very good communicative meeting app but to make you host or to have contacts you have to PAY THEMüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª Very unsatisfying üòîüòîüòîüòîüòîüòîüòìüòìüòìüòìüòìüòì,1
"Works for the most part except that meeting invites, and the link provided for them, isn't recognized by the app (or even hyperlinked), so you have to manually copy and paste the entire message into a web browser, trim the ""you've been invited to..."" part off, and THEN you can join the meeting. Pretty inconvenient to say the least",0
In this there is a network problem many time and many time it show the meeting is full and it creates difficulty for me so my humble request please make more comfortable this app so that there is no problem in this and make app larger for many people to join this.,0
"Dialpad Meetings (fka UberConference) is easy to use and effective as a teleconferencing tool. Disappointing that they failed to send UberConference users a notification regarding the changes, both the substantive ones and the surprising decision to ""abandon"" the clever brand name of UberC. Will keep using it and explore its capabilities further but not yet giving up my Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or GoToMeeting accounts.",2
I like it sooo much üòçüòç,2

Nice UI But some problems i face personally i.e when speaker is saying something then it appears on screen, thats why we faces some difficulty to recognise upper part of slide.

"Can't use it anymore. After install I've entered email but after that there is nothing, just white screen. Unusable! Update, I've managed to install it. It turns out that you can't sign in to this application if you have active ad blocker. Why is that? Second update, The memory optimization in this app is so bad that hurts. It drains complete RAM. I'll most likely uninstall it as soon as I check with my company. Other similar apps like Telegram, Viber etc. works like a charm. Teams is bloatware.",0
This new update is really bad and it's making it complicated to login !!!,0
"This is an horrible app. It is giving me nightmare. I wasted my evening trying to find out how can I join via link in this app. Anroid app doestn pick up appear.in link automaticallly, it always take us to web version and stupid web version doesnt work properly. Horrible horrible and utterly horrible.",0
Suspected security concern and unsure of the additional features at this time,0
Screen has to stay on during the call. Can't join without turning audio on. Chat not allowed from the app. These things make this app nearly worthless. Really wish Skype weren't going away.,0

"App is perfect right now to my needs. 3 stars to get attention that the PC app isn't as good as this one! 1. Unlike this app, the windows app cannot switch accounts from one organization Teams to another's. Must sign out and sign in each time. 2. The special sharing option of ""Windows whiteboard"" is terribly glitchy and guests can't see it. But it works when I open windows whiteboard from the taskbar, then share the window like any window.

So if I opened the app, I was prompted to sign in. However, I was somehow just invited into a group call over there. Had to restart my phone to stoo it.",0

Really good app. Sound and Video quality never fails me. A recommendation to the developers at Microsoft. The only time the app gives issues is if someone with an extremely bad internet connection does not mute themselves. This causes everyone's voice's to have low quality instead of only the one user with the poor internet issue.,2

"Hey! So, I went through a few peoples' reviews... and wanted to clear up a few things, First, When you turn your data saver ON, and your voice/video quality is poor, it's bcoz of the strength or the connectivity, it'll strain more if the connection is poor and use more net. Second, if you're facing any other problem/glitch/lags, ... just let it be, it's a maintenance prob, and will be solved soon. All I wanted to say!

Sometime giving warning for Android update even thought my android update is upto date. Only that needs to be checked. Coming to other features it is the awesome app I have rarely seen. Good features. If Trams comes to personal use like wsapp and twitter it would gain more popularity and generates revenue,1
Good app but I updated it many times but the new version is not available. Why?,1
The mircosoft teams in the assignment paper not come,0
Pretty good for meetings but it can get pretty laggy.,1

I had to change this to one star since they haven't fixed this yet. It no longer syncs w/the desktop version regarding read status. I have all my convos as read on my computer but the app shows most of them as unread. That needs to be fixed. If I try filtering for unread nothing comes up. I have gone into every convo to mark it as read but there is still a red flag that something is unread. I scroll through every convo and nothing shows as unread so I can't even fix it. Unusable and ridiculous.,0

But overall it wasn't as bad as it could have been. It just didn't look very professional for a job I was working really hard to get. Thankfully, Regardless of the issues; I think I stildid get the job though so there's that!",1

"Great concept of total access to work and business contact. Sharing information, communication, and videos. A must have for any companies.",2
I have to say that over the past 5 years I've noticed a significant improvement in how Microsoft delivers product. Teams is a good example of this. The software is excellent right out of the gate on Android. However given the pandemic Microsoft has really stepped up to the plate releasing features that really improve the work from home experience. Teams is a great product on all their platforms. I love the selection of tools that Microsoft is developing for Android.,2

I have just 1 problem... Viewing the presentation and the chat is not possible at the same time... I hope Google will fix that... Everything else with the app is perfect ‚úåÔ∏è,2
Can't control the audio volume. Zoom override your device audio settings. Otherwise it is perfect.,2
"The Teams app on the Google Pixel 6 Pro asks me to authenticate every time I open the app and it's getting really annoying. I didn't have these issues on my previous phone, a Google Pixel 2.

It's essential that this tool work properly for me.",2
"Very user friendly, thank you",2

Literally not even able to get on no meetings for the past couple of months this is literally the worst meeting app that I've used so far and it takes out so much data and storage from my phone if I could give this a zero star rating I would do better.,0

Good sound quality . Never faced problem on attending meetings up till now.,2
misused by professors.,2
There was no audio most of the time,1
"The app doesn't seem to properly manage my device's audio controllers. After I do any call on teams, my Bluetooth audio stops working for all apps on my phone and I have to force stop teams to get it to work again. It also seems like my phone still thinks that I'm on a call, because the volume buttons change call volume instead of media volume, even hours after the call has ended (until I force stop teams, then volume buttons go back to normal). I have also had several occasions where I can't join a Teams call at all without rebooting my phone. It just hangs on the connecting screen.",0

"Teams works great on my PC. I find the app a little aggrevating because there are so many things going on when i get a notification and all i want to see is the messages. you should be able to just look at a simple list of messages that are being notified instead of a pane with part of a cutboff message. I'm off work and open it in case there's an emergency and then it's like ""i bought donuts"" ""thanks"" ""meme"" ""haha"". that list should show immediately insteadbof an empty window with a picture.",0
calling system is just like 5 star but one zoom app named team games gets hanged so I cannot play it,2

Good application,2
"Note, my current device (Nexus 6P) is officially unsupported(yet?) but the issues stated here also plagued my Nexus 5 which was not unsupported.  I've never had issues with the app itself regarding calls, quality, or performance. My main issue is when I'm not using the app. It has a persistent never-ending notification keeping me signed in long after I've ended my call. The app itself has no apparent way to prevent this and the solution I've found is to actually remove it from my recent apps list. This is far from intuitive and not in line with most app standards. The huge flaw is that it consumes battery at an alarming rate. I've had a full charge drop to 50% in 4 hours because I forgot to kill the app. I would like a setting to prevent persistence or some intelligence in the app to background itself properly. I'll gladly adjust my review when that is remedied.",0
"I love the app it is very easy to use, and the quality of its sound is very okay I really like it",2

"Worked ok, didn't want video of me going out, and required permission to turn on and record stills/video, so that worked out ok. Some how to connect audio, thru internet for me, also worked. Takes a while to learn the interface, not that different than Zoom or Jitsi, so figured it out, gave me some tech to do during mostly talking. 20211212 another, this didn't work at all, unuseable, maybe connection date/time, complained on cert, etc",1
It is very bad App doesn't work at phone.,0
Disconnects when I go to other apps unlike the older versions. I cant read my skype messages while meeting is ongoing. Not sure if it is just with the note 5. But all in all it does not allow me to do my work on phone efficiently anymore.,1
"Great service, my congregation and I are very please with UberConference.",2
This is a awesome place for group meeting. And the feature of this app is very easy to use,2
Great App. The black theme is kinda lame though. Add dark blue or a green gradient background. Just some mild color infusion in the theme would be nice. Zoom looks like it's from the 90s.,2

The app is good but I am giving it 3 stars because this app is not good for studying. 1.First thing is that the teachers can't see the student's name. 2.Second thing us that there is no message box for teachers to write notes for students. 3.Third thing is there is no thing for presentation of screen. I think for studying Google meet app is good than Go To meeting.,1

Worked for two years, suddenly stopped. Works on my phone and two other computers, but not my table. Please fix this. Then on the computer I use to lead meetings, instructional pop ups block the audio and video buttons so I cannot see to mute or unmute. Reported bugs, no response from Zoom.",1
"There are a lot of recent improvements, like in car mode. It is easy to use.",2
Wrost time bakwas app dont download,0
"Not so nice app I updated it in the phone for online class but when teachers are talking we can't see them we can see only 6 students video quality is not nice ,better go with the zoom app",1
Bhari aahe app,2
Screen keeps blinking and I can barely turn it off.,0
"It is alwaysleaving froma meeting, It happened at 2 times a day. We can't listen online classes properly because of this. Plz fix this bug, It is there from the last 3 updates.",0
It is nice but it take of have to use it properly we need to a high quality network,1
Good,2
So many things asking wgen we r link to conect directly,0
This app is good but it doesn't have hindi caption and I think that developer should make video quality good,1
Eyes are becoming weak due to online lecture and because of zoom app only. I am very disappointed with zoom ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è worst app. Students are getting spectacles because of online lectures.,0
This is a very important app for the teacher,2
Great app. It's remember my covid-19 time.,2
This thing never works. It never never works,0

I am not able to join the video call itis showing could not join video call and an option is there dismiss i am facing lot of problem,0
Uses a lot of data in meeting,1
"Why is there no proper grid view when using the app on a tablet (in my case, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+) ? The fact that I can't see more than 4 people at a time and that I have to swipe to the next page to see the other call participants is ridiculous especially on a tablet. On the desktop app, I have the option to see at least 12 participants in the same grid view window. Why is it not the same on an Android tablet? It should not be the same as on the phone but adjust according to screen size.",0
Good job but I am 3 star because I am not comfortable for this ap,1
The Desktop version of GTM is great but the Android app is rather limited. I plan to use this app to help low income clients and it is important that their can show their documents to me via screen sharing. Most of my clients cannot afford laptops or iOS devices. It will be nice if your Android version can measure up with the rest fleet.,0
This app is nice but there is a glitch the screen is black,1
Good afternoon I finished the update but there are still no effects or background help me please I need it for my online class thank you..,1
"1. Notifications are on, but no notifications actually. 2. People calling me, but no any visual widgeds to answer, just ringing phone. 3. Logout capability is not found. Only uninstalling (done). 4. Caledar view is ugly and hardly usable. Unfortunately have to use. Tried on Android 9 and 11. Same smell from desctop app on Linux and Mac. Issues are different.",0
Faltu application,0
Easy to use. Great for videos and training. Update 10/25/21...The app continues to get easier and more intuitive. The ability to video each session and it automatically gets loaded to the chat channel is excellent!,2
The screen is too small and i have a mic problem low volume but my mic keep make a noise when i turn on my mic i can't speak and everyone can't hear my voice???,0
I couldn't change the background of meet and also unable raise hand.I updated the app then also I didn't see any changes,1
Needs better silent updates and sync and somehow improve performance on network hogging,1
Works well,2
Abysmal audio quality compared to zoom.,0
Yes good,2
My microphone won't work. It keeps telling me I need wifi or cellular data (which I have both). This is really frustrating since this is how I am required to meet with my Dr. I have a Samsung S21,0
Great for meeting virtually,2
The camera is not oning it is saying your CPU is high in all devices,2
Was easy to handle and guide through it the only problem was the video kept heading out and I have a strong Wi-Fi signal so I don't know why,2
Ggod,2
Nice,1
O wow really amazing application love you,2
üò•üò•üò•üò•,1
First it was good. Now unable to get notifications,0
fair enough,1
"This is a really Nice app, But there are some issues like today I had class and my video isn't turning on. Same with the mic. Please fix this, and another issue is that it does not let me join the class it says ""Couldn't connect you to a video call"" I have checked the code, The Camera, Uninstall the app and install it again, But it is not working. Please fix it.",2
lots of lag. or failure of messages,1
"Whenever i'm presenting for my class,the audio is always unclear and to the point where i'm unable to participate for the group presentation.my internet connection is fine for streaming when i'm on other meeting apps but when using webex,it buffers and i can't hear my lecturer's voice.the app itself is good and usable during regular lectures but whenever i have to present,it kept connecting and exits out of nowhere.",2
My mic is not working only on this app I have tried with every device so pls help me know resolve this issue,1
I like it just not the way it's deployed. Looking forward to 'delayed post/meetings'. Good job all round.,2
My camera turned dark like its on a dark filter after a while. I tried install and uninstall several times. But this still happens,1
"App Data gets really large, mine is close to 900MB. Really need an option to say only keep last month, or 3 months locally.",1
Choppy audio hard to manage app was not super responsive. IE unmuting the mic might take a couple of seconds or be delayed. I think there are better apps out there.,0
"I've used zoom since 2015 when convenience trumped security. It's always been easy to use, much more reliable than competitors WebEx, beehive, Meet, Skype (which was great until we started seeing ads during our meetings, whose idea was that?!)",2
Difficult to log in . Buggy. A,0

Gooe great,2
Okey,2

Superb,2
Google meet is good app I have been using this app for years but now there is a problem I can't hear anything in the meeting but if can fix this problem please fix it,1
Excellent,2
I have an error report my camera option is not there for some reason plz fix that overall it's a good app,1
"it will be good , if we can get keyboard and mouse control for mobile",1
"I have been trying to Install the App on my mobile phone over 2weeks now but its just saying ""waiting for download""",0
It's was crystal clear audio session,1
Every week it is asking for the update and once you update it you won't be able to get the message again you need to uninstall it,0
Suddenly we see different layouts and it's disturbing when you are in meeting. Moreover desktop app is crashing down and difficult to attend calls,2
I have a meeting to record and I cannot do it directly from the app. I am using a screen recording app but there is no sound since audio recording is probably not enabled. So could the developers enable the audio recording so I can record my meeting?,0
App refuses to close. Always running. Doesn't remember credentials. Can't full screen presentations or zoom them. This is a half arsed implementation.,0
Very helpful in a visual meeting and clear the audio so nice app...,2
Really frustrated by multiple attempts to enter court hearings on 2 separate occasions months apart. I would not give it one star rating because it is complex to use and doubly unreliable. I didn't get the chance to be offended by ads.,0
Very easy to log into meetings and once you've done few it remembers recent meeting IDs so you dont have to. A bit stressful when I recently forgot my password but was easy enough to resolve in the end.,2
"The audio quality was very good, and i like the layout of the app. I had a problem with my video. Prior to starting my call, my camera preview of what i looked like appeared fine. After starting the meeting, however, my video was black with very little light exposure. I could turn my camera towards the window and see sunlight but all other details were dark and impossible to make out. I would think this were an issue with my camera if not for the fact that the pre-call preview looked fine.",1
"My phone got hang completely on the first time when try to make a call via ""goto meeting"" link.",0
Very nice app for video calling meeting,2
It is good but u want to update more,2
Why it is not able to open any documents ü§¨,0
Excellent service,2
Very patchy. It kept having to buffer.,0
Very useful specially this time for business and school,2
"Does not work with BlueTooth and does not show proper names for devices. E.g. hash-names are shown, such as ""7f6c1"", ""3d560"" instead of ""Camera, front"", ""Camera, brack"". No bluetooth headset support, makes it completely useless, for me atleast. Please fix! The service works OK in Google Chrome but is really resource heavy, was hoping for some sort of ""acceleration"" by using the App instead, but it is actually worse than just using a browser.",0
Nice,2
good app,2
This is very good,2
Hello when I get into meet my net slow down to 0.22 mbs and I have a good wifi,0
"This is a good app, but i'd given only 2 ‚òÖ‚òÖ because in the video they are showing that we can change the background but in my phone this option is not coming otherwise good üëçüèª",0

It's not a good app zoom meeting is better than this but my online school is going on it I am telling teachers and sir take online class on zoom but they are not listening the teachers is saying there is no use because there not educated always internet and audio issue,0
Uber > Skype. That is all.  My favorite online conferencing app comes to Android. Bloody fantastic! Works great on Android. Is absolutely outstanding on the desktop.,2
But it too slow to load apps or download,1
Nice app but it takes more data when I take online class and one more thing is it's only given 40 min to online meeting that's cause some important topic not discussed at that time I think it would be better if it's time period is increase...,1
"This app is great, but whenever I join a meeting it always freezes and I can't touch anything on my screen until I leave the meeting.",1
"Bit prone to crashing my phone when closing long video meetings, and doesn't interact well with the combination of phone lock screen and MS authenticator when a call is ringing. Also accumulates a lot of storage in the phone memory not the SD card. So consideration of the user experience aside, it does the job.",0
"dunno why, I already use GM b4 but why so hard, its been weeks but can't still use this to our online class, I have same account just diff. phone. so frustrating so many questions.",1
"Webex for me is flexible,everytime I attend the meeting it's smooth there no hassle to join in the meeting.thank you webexüôè",2

"The basic functionality that is the ability to schedule a conference call 
using the app is extremely buggy. There are major bugs in this whole 
application. Whenever you try to set up the conference says it is unable to 
do it, however it still sends out an email saying that the conference is 
scheduled, but when you log back into the app, there is no record of a 
conference in the actual dashboard so there's no way to modify it if the 
time changes without creating a completely new conference. Also when you 
try to add a participant directly to the fields in the app, it says cannot 
create the contact even though all the details of properly typed in. These 
are long-standing problems that need to be addressed, it's a real 
irritation with this app.",0
