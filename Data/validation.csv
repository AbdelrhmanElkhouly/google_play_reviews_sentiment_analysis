"I hate this app. Meetings got cut automatically even after updating it..don't know, what's the problem 🙄",0
Multiple devices and even multiple sessions with the same account is so intuitive. I wish the I could easily rearrange attendee images on screen and the vision quality were as good as the major competitor. Really enjoying it so far.,2
"Battery black hole. Forced to use it for work. Alarm did not go off this morning because it decided to continue running and eating resources through the night until the phone died. Used 25% of the battery. The next highest battery usage was YouTube for 6%. Mmhmm, terrible. Please optimize. It's also not that easy to use, slow, and unintuitive. While it looks more professional than Google Meets, it does not compete.",0

"Strange, the owner of this company created Google voice, yet the app on the iPhone is much better.  It allows you to select groups you created online where the droid does not.  In addition you can only schedule calls immediately (same on iPhone).  Being kind with a 3 star rating as I love UberConference, however until those corrections are made, app is virtually useless",1
So so,2
Easy and accessible to use via mobile. Teams calls are also reliable.,2
The call was going in and out and also my screen kept going black during the meeting,1
Zoom has been a very good tool for me. It has allowed me to maintain a spiritual routine and it works almost flawlessly.,2
"Stop making mobile number mandatory. I'm already doing registration with my work email for work purposes, since I don't have any work mobile number I'm not comfortable linking my personal number with my work account.",0
"It wasn't clear hearing other parties speak, they kept breaking up and kicked off the service. It would be nice to hear more clearly.video keep pausing",2
God is love,0
Easy to use. Great applications. Only thing I don't like is that it does not allow for deleting chats.,2
THANIAUNG112AGMAILCOM,0
Had a two day Excel training. It was great. Connection was strong and picture was clear. Audio as well. Great video meeting!,2
What an unsecure app and unskillful professionals who can't maintain the app for a week. Gets upadates every other day. It's so irritating. You guys can not handle this for even a week or so.,0
"Easy to use, good quality, very little learning curve",2
This meeting communication is very good.....go to metting app carefully guide to me........ obiliously help me....,2

Wonderful app 😋😋😋🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊,2
"It is a very good app for communication. Many features are there like screen sharing, chatting etc. And it helped a lot in online classes. But the reason is that I gave four stars to this app is that it cannot hold more than 100 people. When two or more classes are merged it creates a problem. If anyone can from Google Meet team fix this problem than it best app for communication. I would tell to this team that team should add more features for sharing screen. Otherwise it was excellent app. Thx",2
Not very good app voice is breaking video is pausing I couldn't present some time😠😠😠😠😠😤💢🗯️,1
It will be good if the improve the audio system and add more features.,1

"This app really help me but, I cant use virtual background and what i need to do?",1
"It's great for an organization to organize communication, especially when it comes to having multiple WhatsApp chats. Missing 1 feature: • Sending a person's contact info via MS Teams. Right now there are no options. WhatsApp allows you to conveniently share contacts.",1
Camara dont show the person when in zoom,1
Inability to cut off camera and mic before joining a meeting drew some very unwanted attention rejoining in a noisy environment. Ability to stay connected when shifting from WiFi to LTE is very poor leading to the above issue.,0
When I go to sign up they says- You are not eligible for sign up But why????,0
I don't like this app,0
This app is amazing me and my friends could talk all day!!!!!and gonna rate it 5 stars,2
Good app and learner,0
"Sometimes hang and sluggish, no volume control up or down option in the app neither the phone options works on speaker, login second time or refreshing make the app hang again for a while. On laptop same issues except the volume with too much lagging.",1
It crashes and I can't hear sound when I join a meeting. Pls solve my problem as soon as possible,0

It's a ossum video conference aap I luv to use this app,2
I would have given it 5 stars but the video is getting very dark from the last month.,0
"There r no more options,other than different apps,r nice,but nice...",1
"Activating and deactivating mute can be delayed by several seconds. Voice latency is often 1 or 2 seconds, making it impossible to have a realtime conversation. Might as well be on the moon.",0

Very faint noise...Unable to recognize words properly..Outside noise disturbance is there continuously...Overall improvement is required like Zoom ... Namaste.,1
Drops calls,1
super buggy,0
"So many bugs like on plugging headset sound comes from phone speakers sometimes, can't see join button most of the times and some more bugs. This app is so annoying. And on laptop it hangs so much and freezes the system. Edit : After recent update assignments don't open anymore. So how do you want people to submit assignments without knowing the questions.",0
"Muilti party works well on laptop/desktop connections but dreadful on mobile, even with lte. (Picture lag, distorted audio)",1
Very nice,2
"It simply is unable to show the full screen on most of the occassions when joined using mobile app, this was not the case earlier.",1
Please add a new feature where the meet would ask ones whether to turn on the mic and also add the feature of auto turn off mic when it is not in use,1
When someone wants to call me but they cant hear me:( but good app,0
We were in the waiting room. I don't understand why it didn't connect when the host arrived. My daughter and I are upset. What should we do if it doesn't connect at the appointed visit time?,0
No baground for my tab i love it because It's showing Google Workspace And Delepoper as to give me baground Please,0
Perfect for my growing business as we launch worldwide,2
I am not join in terms I don't know why,1
There is still some technical issues going on. The host had someone speaking softly to them while another speaker was giving their report. The camera was shaking at some points and it did not capture everyone in the room or the person giving presentation.,1
It can use,0
"its working good , need one big change. i.e Only latest feeds showing , there is no way to view old feeds while scrool down.",2
Shohagranashohagrana96@gmail. Com,2
It is worst app like tik tok.,0
best app but one suggestion that you should be given us a option to make an host/admin of meeting while meeting... Please.....,1
Audio changed output sources after we had a practice session on a government meeting open to the public. It was an extremely embarrassing situation that reflects negatively on our production and services. Would not recommend to be used by others.,0
It would be nice to have a voice equalizer next to the caller to tell where noise is coming from like another free Tele-conference I used!,1
Sometimes it gives too much problem. I can't connect with audio and it is also not showing the option pf virtual background and i had updated the app many times than also not showing. .. 🙏🙏 Plss help me..,1
"Update: Based on the quick & very pleasant reply from LogMeln, Inc, below, I've changed to a 3* rating. Due to illness, I'm unable to do online yoga classes right now. Hopefully, in a few days, I can get back in there & use the app. Was: I'm trying to sign up for Airmid Yoga online classes, but I erroneously signed up for a free trial with GoToMeeting, which is now going to charge me monthly. I do not want this to happen. Please remove me from paying for something I don't need.",1
Impressed,1
"Significantly worse experience in audio quality and battery drain, compared to similar confrencing apps.",1
"Had this 2 years ago and it worked great. Wasn't using it so uninstalled. Put it back in for meeting and can't get audio to work. Calling in is not the same as you can't see if someone else has the floor, creates crosstalk. Frustrating! I have good connection. Yes I have a different model phone but same brand. Still having to use call in as ot won't work on the internet audio",0
Excellent,2
Volume not proper. Rest is fine,1
Virtual background option are not showing please fix it please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏,0
Nowadays it's giving too much problem. The people are getting disconnected everytime. We cannot join after. I request you to check this issue.,0
"This app is just awesome. The audio is clear. I recommend it to everyone who wants to hold and omline meeting with staffs, business organizations and many more.",2
Such a bad app. Dont use it. Nothing can be heard. Wastage of a lot of data. I insist not to install this app. Never used such a bad app.totally disappointed,0
Very simplified,2
"Every time it says there's an update, the Android app will NOT update. Please fix this bug.",1
I give 4 star for the google meet i don t give more 1 because i my ohone the background is not gived next update background in all phone🙏🙏🙏,2

Superb,2
"I want to watch video stored in my local device while meet is going on and if meet is going on, then it creates interruptions with the video which I am watching . To help you more, follow the below steps: 1. Join a meeting 2. Let meeting run in background 3.Play a video on your device 4. And watch the video (you will see minute interruptions after specific intervals of time)",0
Nice,2
Very nice. Seems that I already used it though it's my first time. So easy to navigate.,2

The best VC solution in market. The Vc devices suit any borad room or huddle room. Works like a charm with lifesize Cloud.. Connect from any Vc hw device or browser on laptop or tab or phone.. Low bandwidth needed.. Ease of use is its strength.. And using it seamlessly since 2 years across the world.. They added lifesize Go which is free for 8 participants and no agent or regn.. Thumbs up Lifesize Team.,2

"It would have been a 5 star if the chatbox did not take my whole screen. As, on the web version the chat box does not take up the whole screen. I am using tablet and it would've been great if it was like on the web version.",1

Desktop web is fantastic. Can't use on OZ mobile. No number outside US:(,1
Not Satisfied,2
"The Teams app is broken garbage. Used to be able to join meetings without even being logged in to an account in the app. The app now forces you to log in to a MS account in order to join a meeting. The dialog where you enter your email address doesn't recognize multiple of my MS usernames. But I am able to log in via web browser and directly in the teams app itself. Even AFTER logging in to a MS account in the app, it STILL asks for your username and fails when joining. Useless garbage",0
Brilliant. Love it for video conferencing.,2
I like the visual but the sound is not as loud as my phone it was hard to hear,2
"Just fine, all the time.",2
This app is nice and very friendly. The problem here is it requires very high network to function. Sometimes one keeps on going in and out of a meeting.,1
Good,2
"Problem (please read this and fix it , in your great app) Problem is, When we connect our bluetooth headphone (without mic) only for listening , then also it not provide any sound , please Fix it by which our mobile only use the mic but We can listen the meeting in Headphone also (I have a Headphone which don't have mic but want to listen the sound in it )",2
Worst,0
There's no option for us to dial into the conference via phone data call. We basically need to call a phone number which isn't toll free for where I'm from. Conference calls via the PC doesn't have this problem. Even Google hangouts enables this which is what I'm coming from.,0
I like it because it's better than zoom need more network but Google meet want only some Network l will update Google meet updating after I will enter the Google I was change and I like it my name is krishna theerth call only that,2

I try to search it up to find the way to fix it and it is not working on me. My phone is Samsung J3 and there is no update button on my google meet. Pls add the ""Raise Hand"" on other mobile devices. -Sincerly,Carl",1
good ease of access but no interaction on my end so it's a bit hard to rate.,1
Great for business gatherings. Not to mention the amounts of money it saves over time and preparations.,2
Great new app frOM Facebook I do,2
"Indeed, the begining version was very good enough, compare to the present version. Because; in the new version you did remove the option of *back to meeting* it irritates alot !! If my internet connection is bit poor, then i Will be thrown away from the meeting all of a sudden! And i have to enter the password everytime after getting out of the meeting, as there's no option of back to meet...! And also try to give some standard vision to the screen as well. Pls do fix these issues asap!",0

"For a platform that was used for several meetings, Zoom is really bad compared to its competitors. I got late + forced to get kicked out in the middle of a meeting several times just to notify me about an app update!",0
"First time user and I really enjoy it. Primairly used for school. Update: I guess this app updated because now, when I connect my headphones, my professor sounds like Alvin from the chipmunks... and it's only on my Samsung tab s 6. Could this be fixed? I've tried everything.",1

I updated the app cause IT TELLED ME BUT I CAN'T STILL ENTER SO 3 STARS,1
The sound quality is good but as far as seeing others you have to keep going through the screen and it's just a lot it will be good if you could turn your phone sideways and see whoever has video at one time. Also at some points you can't hear everything the quality is off. However I do like that it's a video conference.,1
Very functional!,2
"I would love to see option, to mark notification as 'unread'",2
Poor sound noise quality,0
"The quality is good however, the lack of customization takes away from the experience. As a participant of a webinar, I do not want to see every message on my screen, I do not need to see who joined the meeting. Those notifications just get in the way of the presentation and cover important information. Allow me to get rid of them.",0
Good quality and I like that troubleshooting menu,2
Best,2
Great app. I don't see any widget available. It would be better for some quick settings. No integration is available with Microsoft launcher too,2
This is The best app ever for online classes but it's ask for newer version but this is The best app ever I liked it soo much thanku for making this app google I appreciate your work well done and i want to add a feature that low device like 2 GM ram or 1 GM ram phone's can also put background in a meet I appreciate your work google nice five star for your hard work and intelligence nice make more app like this nice.,2

Drained my battery from 100% to 20% in an hour. My phone got so hot that I couldn't touch it and had to turn it off entirely. Using the app is helpful in connecting with others during these times but I also can't afford to have my battery explode and be left without a phone.,0
This is the most useless app i have ever used. If there would be 0 star rating option i will give it 0 because it takes a lot of data but i always got disconnected while joining class and it always gives useless updates which also takes a lot of data. I would request all of you to not download this app.,0
Exelent app,2
Enjoyed the info but the volume was going up and down during the presentation.,2

"Zoom has had a long time for developers to catch up in terms of matching the functionality available in the PC app with what's available on mobile apps and on Chrome OS. The Zoom experience on Chrome OS is unforgivably poor and underpowered - and Android is not far behind. This is inexcusable at this point. Zoom, please stop pretending that Chrome OS and Android Apps do not matter. You ought to provide a seamless, matching, complete experience via a browser web app. Even an excellent Android app (with all the functionality that PC or Mac apps enjoy) - if it were permitted (installable) on Chrome OS (Chromebooks) via Google Play would be a great step forward - and yet over the past year and a half, you've actually withdrawn much of that functionality instead.",0

This was the very first time that I used this app and my laptop experienced an issue that I still have yet to resolve. I then went to my phone and each time that I did something wrong the app would show me / tell me what to do and it was corrected. Therefore I say it's great for new users because it literally helps you and walks you through each step of the process until you are successful.,2

How can we get connected to Bluetooth speaker during meeting,0
The new update for those using tablets is incredible. But one major problem is that the chat box still takes up the whole screen during the meeting. It would've been better if the chat screen was like on the side like on desktops. and as such we could follow the meeting AND chat at the same time..,1
It doesn't let me invite people with email 😊 fix it please I need my business up next month I will use SRM now till you fix it,0
I i will see,1
Loved that we could talk and share documents,2
"It does not give you enough time , it keeps you out way too soon, before the 45 minutes expires, and it gives you a poor option to connect the audio , you have to click it several times before the sound can be heard, I CAN'T EVEN UPDATE, IT DOES NOT OPEN 🌝👎",0
Much love for this app,2
I have to uninstall and Install again in couple of days.. it logs out my account every 5 days or so.. it's really bad I cannot attend my lec properly,1
"had it a week then it stopped working, just says content unavailable. Boss is angered that I haven't responded to my coworkers but I haven't been able to see anything. Facebook better pay my bills when I get fired for their bs",0
It has so many ads please fix it I don't need any ad,0
Hehehege,0
"Since the update to the app to add the video, the app has had many issues, it mutes people, it kicks people out of the call, or it has sound issues.",0
Easy to chat,2
Need more development,0
Totally terrific,2
"I've used several different conference call services, but UberConfrence is the best. I'm definitely gonna upgrade to the premium account.",2
Its not working,0
"Working fine, great voice and video calla bad emoji, can not replay to post on desktop app",1
Not able to create meeting id in app. The app keeps on loading even after 10mins,0
It was easy to use and the only thing we couldn't do was use our bluetooth Bose speaker to project the voice. Picture quality was good and sound was good on the app just not able to use my sound link mini,2
Nice,1
"Not working what so ever, will not let you log in no matter credentials or info, this has been fustrating",0
Facebook,2
Good. But the sound needs to be more clear.,1
5 star app but before this new update. In this new update we can't mute other fellow's mic . Some time we forget to mute our mic after a conversation than our personal talks are broadcasting in whole meeting. Before any of fellow mate could mute it for us if we are not aware . But now it's not possible in this new update . Google nobody is gonna mute his boss in a meeting they are all sensible people attending meet. Its not a dating app. For stop misusing this you can just show a notification,0
Nice,1
Zoom is a chat app for me a bit to complex for personal purposes you have to create a (room) to chat plus create a variable unique code to contact the other person and couple other things which to me it makes it unappealing to use it like i said for personal purposes. for bussiness i guess it is the right chat app but with glitches.,0
"Keeps closing. As I try to post, the app keeps crashing. Seems to be of little use.",0
It is very nice app but background is not changing in my android phone during my meetings. why is this not comOKng for android??,1
Good,2
Great app with nice features like the integrated calendar but I notice there's a lower quality of video chat compared to their competitors.,2

If you are runing a between class is only 40 minute he are very bad,0
It's difficult for the host to know what to do to get everything set up and working. The quality of the sound and video was poor. I don't like having to download something to my phone. The phone no. to call if someone wants to participate that way is long distance It is a way to communicate with sound and video though.,0
"The entire process was extremely simple and the proper procedures to connect to my meeting were all handled by the app, which was great because I had no clue what I was doing.",2
It's easy to use and it does the job. I've used the screen share a million times and it's super useful.,2
It's a good app but recntly the popup feature has been a headache I mean once I use the feature to go to another tab after I can't full screen it I have end the meet and join again !!!! Hope u do something about this,1
Cannot control volume level on earphones. It is too loud to be comfortabe and there is no way to reduce it.,0
It ok needs a bit of work,1
"Since we started using it, everything is going well for us. And there has been no complaints. I love it.",2
Very Useful App... But 1 issue not a major one but when u have done the full screen and u want to exit the full screen and at that time people are leaving the meet we aren't able to click on the full screen option to exit... So kindly check on this,2
Very helpful in covid time but need more updates by the way if best,2
This app takes too much net,0
opening my job just takes me to the website everytime and it takes forever to load. after that i have to sign in and it loads again. what was the point of the app of its just going to take me to the website? it also loggs me out randomly and says i can only use a temporary login,0
Audio was not working and was laggy,0
How long will you take? It's been almost 90days. Still the same problem after 45 days. do you really act on feedback? Are you planning to discontinue the app? not supporting simultaneous web cams in Android app. strange such a big licence fees but missing on basic facility of web meeting. even whatsapp call support this.,0
"Good but it's not the same for mobile, like the background, pls add the background for mobile, it will be very cool",2
"This app is fine sound quality good visual quality is good, but I can't see raise hand option in this app??",1
"After the update, a lot of errors appeared, both on my phone and my computer constantly reported password errors even though i had entered correctly. Your app after tje update loses stability, often not responding, causing me to stall a lot of things.",0
Very reliable service!,2
It's so easy to attend meetings..,1
"The new ui is great, but it's connection to identity management is crap. I'm fine to jump into a meeting I'm invited to, but I can't host a meeting more often than not because it doesn't recognise me as signed in. I might be based on where I'm located. If so, you need to widen the geographical locations of your directory.",1
"It was my first one, and I love the ambition and the encouragement and recognition for doing well",2
It's a very good app,1
Have never had a problem using this app. Pretty straightforward.,2

Good audible and quality,2
Fairly okay output. Just for some minor hitches.,1
My luck why mean zoom is not comming I'm tab I luck this meeting,2
Meh- i wanted to use this as a shortcut to call into meetings but if I don't personally have an account (my company obviously does) it doesn't let you use most of the features like saving the meetings or creating a reminder.,0
How do I delete my account???,1
It's amazing but we need whiteboard on it to make are work easier than now,0

The messages which are in read status in desktop shows as unread in mobile app. And then it shows unread in both the apps. Also images does not open up in either ones. Browser version works fine though.",1
Horrible video feed,1
Had an important conference call and the app kept closing and saying not working. Kept having to close and reopen and force stopping the app to get it to work correctly. We use this app frequently for visual conference calls and I would like to see the app work correctly please.,0

I can't find virtual background option in setting please give virtual background option on mobile buT the app is great for my online classes,2
This app is good. Doesn't cause hot performance ram to my device but sometimes slower in stream conference.,1
Audio and video needs more updates. The audio is eirther very loud or very soft. The picture quality is okay not great. Some of the features can be improved a lot. The chat feature needs to be improved to where you can see it and live video at the same time.,1
very buggy,0
Audio issue,1
I think when I installed this app 4 or 5 months ago it was excellent but when I updated it gets worse . My connection is good . But when I try to join it shows connection error and I am a student. I am not able to attend my important lectures . My teachers are also facing this issues . Try to solve it as fast as possible . It is getting worse day by day . Now when I join a meeting after video options it shows connecting and ultimately says that it couldn't connect . My network is also amazing .,1
Im rating the android version as 5 but the pc is 3 unfortunately because it's laggy,2
Please make update that all features of laptop or desktop come in Mobile phone.,1

Please fix in the next update.",0
"i love the app. works flawlessly. the reasons i haven't given 5 stars is because of the 'XY is now speaking' bar. it usually covers content of the screen. plus, the phone doesn't enter full-screen mode in landscape mode in which the statusbar and navigation bar takes unnecessary space.",1
Average app in online learning,1

Excellent app,2
Lovely,2
No blurred background or even any background effects at all. Zoom for Android has this functionality. This is a basic and necessary requirement for many who need to use Teams for work meetings while out of the office.,0
It's OK for me. It's very easy to use especially when with meetings,0

"It's a workable platform. Sometimes very confusing for the presenter on how to share screens or if their screen is still showing to the audience. There are certainly plenty of options out there if you have a choice on webinar platforms and it mostly comes down to which options you want. WebEx could be better, easier to use, but it works well enough for most situations.",1

Later on I opened it after searching for it in playstore. What should I do for getting icon in phone? Should I remove & reinstall it?,2
The take a photo option to submit assignment doesnt work after the recent update in my android. Also attached documents in word or ppt also doesnt open now. :(,0
"Great for face to face meetings without the problems of getting there, the dangers of contracting any illnesses (like covid), or dealing with poor air quality. For some people who are currently at high risk, staying home and still having meetings is great. They still get to see who they need to see and have no worries about further health risks. A perfect way to keep in touch and stay safe. Will continue to use this as often as possible and for as long as possible and practical.",2

it is good app for taking class. But there is some issue I am facing from the day have download it the problem is sometimes it stops the class automatically and there is limited edition of time only 50 min. So I don't like that but it is good app . I am giving 4 stars because of the problem.,2
Doesn't give video settings options. To set a vedio background you have to be in a meeting call to do that.,1
Would love to be able to see more than 4 participants on the same screen. I use a top of the line tablet which should be able to easily have more participants on the screen at the same time. The app is good and works well. Would love this feature.,2

Nice app but after updating I am facing the problem of mike y students were not able to hear my voice and if I switch on the speaker I am able to hear their voice but my voice is not reachable to them .In every class I am facing this problem.I will recommend not to update your meet.,0
"Couldn't sign in, every times getting problem Couldn't sign in, every times getting problem",0
I just get a webview without the option to join an already existing room..,0
Not crazy for it.. Don't like it 😕,0

My head phone does not connect during using this app,2
"One of the worst meeting app found ever. It's features are just annoying me. It gets stuck anywhere, anytime. The screen automatically zooms out or gets minimized even without touching the screen. There is also no time limit in it. The reason of even one star is it sometimes by mistake works good. Really unsatisfied with the app. Request is to work on it for better experience",0
"App asks me for password over some period of time. I do not need that security and I didn't find the options to turn it off. Also, when my mobile phone is on the bluetooth speaker, sound of the call will go directly to that speaker even though I am only using it for the media and my phone is on the silence mode.",0
Its a weird app,1
It was great! So far all of the presenters have been very kind and very informative!,2
"Featurea for microphone and audio are not separated. Means when you have line problems, reconnecting will on themic. Wth. Mic off is off la.",0
Comment option not show,1
👍,1
A bit complicated to use,1
Too slow,0
"1st time I used this app seemed to work well ,couldn't figure out how you put your hand up to ask a question, Hopefully next time I will figure out how to use that feature.",2
It is a great app. No down falls. Very good to use on my cell on the go.,2
"I use this app for my online classes on Samsung tab A7 , when ever I unmute to talk, my teacher voice echoes and she can't hear me clearly. Also if she is presenting anything it keeps getting stuck. All the other students can easily go through the classes with out any problem",0
Using the app on my phone was smooth and easy. I participated in an almost three hour meeting without experiencing any bugs.,2
"It's so nice and good but if we didn't update it,it stops",2

This is one of the best app for online class. and i like it but i Don't liked for 5 stars. but its a good app. thanks zoom.,1

Great one.,0
Good,2
1st time using it and 2nd time using a meeting app. I used zoom before. Did not see the thing to click to write out a chat message. Using it on a LG android phone. Audio and video good. Just seemed cumbersome with the layout design.,1
This works so great for business meetings.easy to sign in wow..GREAT AUDIO AND CLEAR SCREEN,2
Ok,1
YE APROVED,0
"It's very useful app,but I have updated for last month,this performance was very slow,for example screen present : it's not clear and not see the screen.and I really appreciate for before meet,this is very very helpful for me, screen present in full screen and and clear the presentation 👍 so I really missed that app . We have updated the app ,but screen presenting in half screen and then it's picture was hide for me please solve the problem",1
Worst experience ! . can't see all the participants on phone .while we can see in PC .in pc we can't adjust the windows size of this app . Screenshot feature is not available on smartphone . requires lot of internet .,0
Love the convenience of being able to contact anybody via text message and or video call period has made work life so much easier.,2
"The app is nice , but the problem is ,you update it all the time why ..for this I will give the app two star",0
Pretty confusing for me. A lot of time wasted on my waiting for the opening part or the direct step to start going in to the meeting.,1
I had problem connecting to ZOOM several times. Need to correct these problems w/ Android phones.,1
Poor video ans sound quality,0
Good,1
"I have the latest phone, pixel 6 pro, but I don't have access to zoom virtual backgrounds??? What's the deal? I don't want people to see where I am, or maybe the room is just messy, but the virtual backgrounds are imperative.",1
Worked great once all set up and figured out. Recommend test run with all your people,2
"GoToMeeting is a polished, stable meeting platform that ""just works"". The problem is that it lacks basic features that literally every single other meeting platform provides... most notably, being able to paste in screenshots, attach files to a chat, etc. Without even that rudimentary functionality, GTM is a dinosaur. I work for Citrix (who ironically used to own GTM), so we still use GTM a lot... however, we are in the process of moving to Teams. It's sad, but GTM just can't keep up. :(",1
Web speech breaks up alot difficult to break into conversation,1
Good,1
In my friends mobile there is a symbol that we can change background but in my moblie there is nothing like that😔,0
Difficult to bluetooth to speaker while casting to tv screen.,0

There was alot of glitches in the meeting we were in.,1

"Had some issues with feedback whenever people start to talk, also had the issue of not being able to display everyone's image at once, but ill admit that could have been User-Error on my end. It works well enough.",1
Outstanding app. I use this frequently to both collaborate with my business partner and support clients.,2
"Overall app is good but, account switching is not good also Notifications get delivered delayed.",1
"It's a good start. It has a lot of problems with notifications (as Workplace Messenger does), it seems to count Facebook and workplace notifications together, and some won't clear out when if there are no actual notifications.",2
Very nice app to conduct meeting up to 100 person and easy to use.,2
Good,2
How many ram MB to running this app?,1
"This app is awesome . It is an good app to listen and to attend classes .But the disadvantage is I can't able to use raise hand option as there is no option to raise hand even also I updated the Google meet's latest version. You should give the option to everyone . You should reply me , how to use it",1
excellent,2
Started off well then totally lost the connection despite sitting close to the Internet hub am glad it was a webinar amd not a job interview,1

"It's ok, but it has a nasty bug. Persons that connect to the conference using the Android app, never get logged as attendees, thus they will never show up as participants to conferences in the History section on the website. It's like they don't exist at al, which is a shame if you want to use the history section for anything useful (such as worktime tracking).",1
Excellent,2
"It kind of does what it is supposed to but notifications are completely broken in it, making it nearly useless. Good for calls though!",0
Not smooth as compared to google meet and zoom,0

Google meet is a good app but a few times it's get stuck during a meet many times I am having good wifi connection It interrupts the class n I miss a lot before I restart the app.,1
Everything is good about it but I cannot open the background screen (green screen) I've also updated this app but nothing is showing! Please see to it,1
I liked this app but there is no background option in mobile so it would be more awesome if you put an option of background . so can you make a change by the next update. Please do the needful,1
"It's a great app, although, it would be awesome if you add a feature to allow locking the meeting on the mobile app. It only allows to lock the meeting from the web. That would be super helpful if possible. Also, it drains the battery pretty fast.",2
Very good app,2
The quality and volume is pretty bad on phones evev with high speed data,0

"It is the worst app for online classes. It is really very sloooooooow. It take a minimum of 5-10 minutes for the teachers to reflect that we have submitted our assignments. This really consumes a lot of time, After the last update, I am not even able to see the reference material of the assigned assignment in this app. It is so slow that the teachers get notified that we are lobby 1 or 2 minutes after we click join.",0

"Last update broke Teams completely. Loads up but as soon as the contacts and chats show, it crashes.",0
"All the features that should help me as a user seem to be broken and it gets in the way of navigation. News flash: I don't use WebEx because I enjoy it, I use it because my company refuses to pivot off of it, and the last few rounds of updates have made it more difficult to use. One example: blocking the users navigation to display a dialog after a meeting has ended, to inform them the meeting has ended, and not closing the dialog when the user clicks ANYWHERE else. I KNOW IT'S OVER DAMMIT!",0

"Bluetooth handling is poor When I switch between Bluetooth devices, for example I attend meeting using my Bluetooth headset. Sometimes, I had to drive to office while I'm still in meeting. When I get into my car, the Bluetooth gets automatically switches to car Bluetooth. However, the audio gets lost. Audio doesn't play in headset, it does play in car. I had to manually change it to car. Other music apps seems to handle this smoothly.",1

"As others say: app is just a wrapper around a web page (which isn't even made for the app, the FAQs aren't relevant, at least one link is broken), you can't join a room that exists only create a room - so 2 people with the app can't communicate.

I think when I installed this app 4 or 5 months ago it was excellent but when I updated it gets worse . My connection is good . But when I try to join it shows connection error and I am a student. I am not able to attend my important lectures . My teachers are also facing this issues . Try to solve it as fast as possible . It is getting worse day by day . Now when I join a meeting after video options it shows connecting and ultimately says that it couldn't connect . My network is also amazing .,1

I love the concept of this program and app BUT when colleagues complain about connectivity issues and frequently drop out of calls it tales the professional edge away from the product.   I am however a loyalist and will stick with it is long as I see progress.,1
"Works for conference calls. If you are having a video conference call on the android app, the screen only shows the video of the mic talking. With 6 people the screen flashes between pics so much that it gives you a headache. I have heard the apple app allows you to see all people (up to 6) on the screen at once. Please fix the android app to do the same.",1

My zoom is not working when I click the link it's only show preparing meeting,1
The sound was fine until I received a phone call during the meeting. After declining the call for some reason the to volume in the session sounded quiet and far away. I have to close WebEx and reenter the meeting for my sound to function normally again.,1
It is very worst...it is very slow....we can't send any ppt it is very tough for us,0

This is best best app I ever use for online class and other are not so easy to join a meeting or class.........,2
"I had to unistalled the app twice. Not using right now. The reason being that the check green mark indicating ""available"" does not synchronize with the app on my computer when I log off/in at work. In the phone app, I am available 24/7 unless I manually change the settings. It is cumberson to have to change it back and forth as I leave / arrive work every day.",0

"Well done Microsoft, you've done it again. Teams is broken again. Everytime it is updated Microsoft break something. It must be uninstalled and reinstalled after every update. Latest problem is that I am now unable to access my tasks - every time I press on one it just reloads the task list page in an eternal loop. Still apprehensive of what feature the next update will break.",0
Booooooooo,2
"Screen transitions and the app in general are clunky. Frequent long delays when loading a few bytes of text. File management is awful with it's constantly wanting to preview in app (no option to disable), and greifig me for using the same filename in a channel without giving a hint of context of the existing file. In app feedback has a confusing message. It sometimes fails to show me some of the messages in a conversation, leaving everyone confused. Support is non existent.",0
Voice delay,1
Facing difficulties with microphone during classes since 5 days 😥 my microphone doesn't work if i try to say anything,0
The worst app i have ever viewed because the sound quality is very low and when i use it on pc the sound is not at all clear and even in mobile it gets disturbed a no. of times and it was best when i used it for first time but then 2nd time onwards it became worst,1
Ok,0

Everything breaks. User experience is horrendous. Its too easy to miss important chats or notifications. Can no longer log in to app.,0
"Good workhorse app. Features could use some improvement and sound quality/video freezing continue to be problematic (that's probably more a network issue for individual participants, but Zoom could provide alerts that network issues are causing a problem).",1
Great and easy to use.,2
"I Suggest that, let the app have the ability to Share Video on the Android Device",1
Worst,0
"It says email address is already registered, then it says email address doesn't match & have to return to app. Can't change details to start from scratch. So can't use this app. Have uninstalled & re-installed & I'm back to emails not matching",0

this is the simplest video audio app i have ever used.,2
My rating about this app of 2 stars is because the voice is not being clear many a times it doesn't work properly.,0
Will change to 5 stars if when I connected to my Bluetooth it actually connected so annoyed right now. No AC in my car means I have to suffer with windows up in order to hear anyone when driving 🤬,0

"What more can you ask for in an app. This is an excellent utility for those that like to get several people together on one line without many of the participants tying up multiple phone lines. On top of that, the options are great for the conference leader, mute, record and more the great thing is that many options are available free. Excellent and a must have utility app.",2
"I have a concern, everytime I have a meet in my course I only see about 4 tiles, with only 2 other people including me and the presentation made by my instructor. Is there a way I can have a tiled view on my tablet? or is it only possible to get tiles view on a pc or laptop? Mine doesn't have a layout option either. I would really like to see all my coursemates everytime we meet. It gets lonely when its only 2 other people I see.",1
Its good but some times data not getting updated. ( like shift schedule n report).,2

Terrible App can't even connect to a call for almost 3 months now,0
Should've added the option to record the meeting without permission or... allow the Android screen recorder to record the meeting which is very disappointing,0
"Just used this app and found it needs a lot of work... Lacks support for multi-windo (which is standard for Android now), can't select other cameras on the device (which is a basic oversight), doesn't have a way to septate audio from video in a single session, Samsung DeX mode is completely unsuported which isn't surprising but WFH makes this needed. Basically this isn't competitive with other UCs in available.",0
First. Learning.,2
I was not able to connect my audio while using this app in my Laptop via Chrome... Please help me so that I can hear the voice of my teacher as in this condition I am not able to hear the voice of others...

"Very good app but I have a recommendation the recommendation is to add which is meeting logs which can be viewed by everyone in the meeting like if someone leaves the meeting it will show when did the person left the meeting, if i present the screen it will show i presented the screen at this time and if i kick someone as a host from the meeting it will also show when did i do it also if u all think this is unsafe then make it just like chat box, in the meeting when i join the meeting and type something in the chat box it will be there but if i leave the meeting it won't be there. so can you make the meeting logs with the features i said? you all can add more features if you want. thank you!",2

Update: this app is now unusable. It logs me out constantly so it's impossible to read and respond to messages. This has been really handy since the pandemic began to keep in contact with coworkers and students. My only complaints come with the video calling. I found screen sharing on the app to be confusing; I wasn't sure how to stop the sharing which is a huge problem.,0

Works OK but I cannot disentangle it from my (now closed) NHS Mail account. I have set up a new account (or thought I had) but it still takes me to an NHS login page which I no longer have credentials for.

Had problems in beginning but it was mostly on my end rather than the program. Wasn't getting sound but realized I needed to increase volume. Then picture went away and wasn't sure how to get back so just join meeting again. Worked well but seemed to drain battery in cell phone quickly.,2

Amazing,2
Why is the installation so big?,0
"No disruption, clear and workable",2
"While a great and secure app for video conferencing, it could definitely use stronger audio capture. I've also had some minor issues with video drop, but only in areas where the connection may be weaker. Overall, a great alternative to zoom if security is a concern.",2
Easy to participate after receiving link from host.,2
Bad app I dont like,0
Unusable app,0
The reason why I gave 3 stars is at 8:00 my drawing class gets started at 8:40 the meeting gets disconnected 2 times in a minute so plz fix this problem,1
I was impressed on being able to stay connected the clarity of the pictures the ability to see four different pictures at the same time and the clarity of the audio.,2
Audio was wavering. Negotiating the app for a first time use was difficult,1
Good but bug is more please give update 😥,1
Just satisfied,1
"Good video quality if the host and client both are using mobile phone. Very blurry video if the host is using mobile but any of the cilent is viewing it on PC. [There's no problem with my network, it has strong bandwidth]",0
Not able to connect through bluetooth earphones!,1
very buggy audio experience,0

It's a great tool to connect with colleague and associates. Clear reception and very easy and convenient to use.,2

Works well for me whenever I am not able to attend meetings directly from my laptop. However the list if meetings in the mobile app is not all listed. I don't see all meetings gets listed here even if I have a WebEx for it. I believe it's a refresh issue.,1
Because I get to download apps so then I get to play games and slot of stuff so I am glad this app play store is in the world I love it.,2
Well done Google meet but the app is taking soo much databut still well done I love this app💜💜💙💙,2

Webex is terrible I was in an meeting which is supposed to last 7 hours I was in the meeting in the morning for about 3 hours and lost contact I tried to get back in many times but I could not hear anything all the meeting could not hear me or could not see me and I could not see them or hear them and I must have tried more than 20 times and it was sporadic sometimes it work for 10 minutes and then it didn't work it was so frustrating people should use zoom instead of this for meetings,0

Good job,2
The greatest strength is that I can have Teams for different accounts all in one app. There is a learning curve because sometimes the functionality is a little clunky. It has gotten better.,2
Normally good but kept missing bits of conversations this evening,1
Audio is gud .. but couldn't keep up with display or screen .. which results in mis gap of communication 🙏,0
i hv no problem with my internit but when i'm inter to google classroom everything will start to laging,0

"Good overall, voicemails need to be highlighted at the bottom banner and should blink or something with the option to ping your phone. I get teams VMs and have no idea till i read my email. Also in the app you have to go to activity to seem them either give them their own icon or move to calls",2
"Really, really slow to down load. Painful wait for download. Late entering meeting due to slow download. Need to be downloaded 1 to 2 days in advance or will miss co defence meetings.",0
"Generally good, but my work account forces me to change passwords periodically and use 2 factor authentication. This 2FA and password entry functionality is very user unfriendly...especially if a message does not arrive. Not clear where to press for 'resend' etc. One gets stuck on that screen.",1
Thankyou I just downloaded it so I don't know much but I tried to clear the cache or whatever it is called but I don't know how,1
"My insurance required a face-to-face appt with my dr. This app made that a breeze, right from my living room! Love it!",2

This is an issue with most of issue. After rejoining also, we are facing the issue of lag and screen is taking so much time to load. After some time screen is getting freezed. Hello support team, could you please look into it. I intentionally don't want to review bad. Please consider. Waiting for your response.",1
The audio was not the best. Some I could hear and some was mumbled.,1
"I am rating online 1 star because,the sound problem is more try to fix this",0
This app is good so far but we really need a 'disable comments' feature for the hosts as we have to face spammers making derogatory comments which disrupt our classes. As a reputed platform you should take steps to include this feature when many other apps do have this feature.,1
Discord is better-,1
Voice cracks sometimes. There is echo also. But the user interface is good.,2
"Didn't login with number, didn't get the Opt for login",0
"The Zoom Android app is absolutely terrible. The UI is hard to navigate, with strange omissions, and not great performance. If you can use the desktop version, absolutely do, because it is so much more user-friendly than this app.",0
"The update is really helpful for me. But I just need a one thing for phone users. Just make the recording option for mobile users also. If you did this option, it helps a lot for mobile users.",1
"The mobile app is fine but the window app sucks harder than my vacuum on full power. I tried clearing caches, signing out, uninstalling but the MS Teams won't stop loadin over and over again. Or maybe I am just unlucky",1

This app is very bad when I send my pdf my pdf never go to my teacher I hate this app and,0
Very super,2
It's good and user friendly! Definitely better than other apps! (But it ain't free unlike some apps),2
Meeting was clear,2
Great Service. Works just fine. Love that the link sent to me connects me directly with the individual rather then a general app.,2
"Apart from initial hangups for joining once it was set it became exceptional i.e. good video and audio link, felt as if I was physically attending the conference.",2
"stupid app, very slow with lots of bugs, asks me to sign in every single time i use it although i enabled auto sign in, prevents me from using my audio or play anything whole it's running in a meeting, please remove and delete the app, I'm desperately waiting for remote learning to be over so i NEVER have to use it ever again.",0
It is good,1
"Keeps relaunching, it's quite annoying. Some messages disappear on the desktop app once I open them on my phone.",1
I love Uber Conference.  It's a great product but unfortunately the app keeps force closing and will not load my contacts so I must give it only 3 stars.  I am using a Galaxy Note 3 on 4.4.2,1
The app won't even load. Just says pending. After trying for an hour I gave up.,0
App does not good i cant continuous uploading my photo..it couse hang.,0

It was quite good. But once I had updated this app it completely stopped working like it wasn't even opening. It say hold on while we get things ready for you. And it's been more than a week.,1
I recommend this app to have an direct message because in the other app similar to this it is very useful like when we want to go to the cr we don't want everyone to read it.,1
Used it for work meetings and it was appreciatively simple and user friendly.,2
Very easy to use. Only used audio but the sound was very clear. Accessed and connected quickly to my meeting.,2

"I was happy about google meet. It is really a good app for mobile. After the recent updates for tablets I was very happy to see raise hand and background features. But during online classes thru Samsung Galaxy A7 tablet, echo issue reported by many students. Also got a mic issue(i.e. I need to speak over the mic to make the sound audible to others). I have the latest android updates dated 1st August 2021. On 13 Sept, after contacting Samsung customer care did ""Reset all Settings"" and following that did ""Factory data reset"". Still having the same issues. On my diagnosis, following is the workaround. Run chrome in desktop mode and use meet on web. But its a bit of headache. This TAB has Samsung OneUI 3.1 and Android 11. I think this spec is the latest provided by Samsung. I am not connected external devices and no extra apps other than google meet. I have very good broadband. All other mobile, laptop, and PC have google meet working without any issue.",0
"Crashes a bunch and does this weird flashy thing on screens like its trying to go to another screen. Also there needs to be a page up botton. So you always have a way to go back to main screens. Teams happens to be trash on pc and mobile has a reply system, thats the only reason im giving it a second star. This app is trash as well.",0

Firstly this app is a very nice app for those students who attend the online classes but one thing we didnot like in this aap i.e when our teacher open the camara we didnot zoom that what our teacher is presenting in the class . And overall this is the best app and I recommend this app for taking online classes . And endly Thanku for the developers,1

I didn't know such app even exists. It works good for the most part. We use it at least three times  day. It allows me to reach out to people's I never imagined reaching out to. I still give the app 5 stars. I've only have encountered one issue. At one point I was able to have my live conference and see who's calling in and who is speaking.  Now i get a error message. No complaints and will recommend it to other. Thanks,2

Teams app is great and built it with required options. It will be great if there is an option enabled for multiple calls as current app can accommodate only one call at a time.,2

Syncing devices is easy but login issues are higher compare to other apps. Every time we need to contact the admin.,0
In order to take a screenshot i need to minimize the screen. In order to send a message I need to maximize the chat function which covers part of the instruction. If I was able to send a message and take a screenshot without having to make changes to the screen instructor I would rate 5.,1

Working good but sometime the voice is not clear either you hearing or saying.so much lag during video chat. Other people can't see the shared screen properly or sometimes not clear and just a black screen. Compare to other products like zoom Google meet needs more work to do here......,0

"Worst app, before updated this app take less data for metting that is for one hour it takes 200 mb only. but for now one hour it takes nearly one Gb. I don't interst install it but after my meetings completed I will sure delete this one. Before update it 200mb for one hour. But now it takes 900mb for one hour. But nothing changes for the update but consuming more data. For single is not worth for it.",0

"If you are searching for an online conference call solution that is easy to use, permirs shared screens and built-in call recording, search no more. Uberconference is all of the above and more. I've used it for months to hold conference calls with professional contacts in number places around the world and *never* experienced a degradation in tge quality of the call or connection. The lack of video conferencing is usually a plus especially with contacts with less developed infrastructures.",2
My all problem get solve,2

"Really good experience. The video and audio quality is very good. I would have given it 5 stars but there is this bug where if I get signed out for some reason or the app updates, it tells me to sign in again, and when I do that, it says just wait while we get things ready for you, and it stays on that screen for hours, and in the end I have to reinstall the software to get it to work. Otherwise the software is good",2
