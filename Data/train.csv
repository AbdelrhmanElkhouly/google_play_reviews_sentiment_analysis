Aditya Ingole Deaf,2
I love the app.! There is no issue but if u could add the feature of do not spotlight on unmute in Android devices then it would be more nice,1
"So hard to use. The web app failed, and the mobile app made me create an account before I could join the conference I was invited to. Poor experience all around. How do I delete this account?",0
I hate that the app makes a sound every time someone comes in the room. Sounds cut out if more than one person speaks at a time. I like Zoom better.,1
"Useless at BSE star MF meet.voice too mych slow cant hear properly, and there was connection issues too.",0
همه شون مسخره اند به مولا قسم ایتز اوکیوووو کوفت,1
I love you app,2
"paki lagay naman po nito katulad sa computer like that. To upload your own image for your background, click Upload a background image Add photo",0
Good,2
"I have some complain about this app, whenever I share screen on Google meet.i automatically leave that meeting (class) how I can solve this problem that why I gave 2 stars.",0
It is a good application but I can't joint to the meeting when I change my account.,1
Very disappointed to know that Zoom virtual background is not supporting tablet,1
Its so hackable by the gov. Or docs. And any hacker can use it as a backdoor to all your devices. And once installed hard to completly clean out . It just reinstalls when you sleep.,1
"I like the mobility the app provides. however, it does tend to be a bit glitchy",1
Close my class,0
Very bad,0
Best,2
Super,1
"Used to work okay. Yesterday it took 45 mins. to get into a meeting. It kept saying passcode error. And today with a different meeting I'm still getting a passcode error, even using copy/paste to avoid chance of error. Today I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but still same error. Ridiculous.",0
Good quality...voice is a little less,1
This app is better than other video conferencing app bcoz in this the operator who arrange the meeting do not want to accept the request of other persons who wants to attend the meeting so time is not wasted to add the persons in the meeting.,1
Awsm,2
Few times its getting auto loggedout and need to login again but it's not loading any thing just rotating the loading symbol and need to reinstall every time,1
worst experience.this app will hang your system and you will be embarassed knowing that yourmic is still on while you are doing casual talks.,0
The best,2
This app makes communication easier while working from home.,2
"The only thing I don't like is the host can not mute the participants. With so many on the meeting, information is garbled.",1
Sir in meet my 3 stars is not coming in my video . 3 stars - virtual background,1
"what app? I tried to install it on my phone, but Microsoft said my phone number was fake.I tried to install it on my computer,but Microsoft would not open the (iconless) app. I really wish our courts would use something different besides this terrible thing.",0
It gives me a hard time when this apps crashes.,1
"Excellent App, there was a little lag during voice call, but a strong internet speed may improve that.",2
"This should be an option inside of facebook itself. Then I wouldn't have to 
create multiple accounts.",1
This app is not good enough so much noise and Disterbense and they told so many options but I can't find them at all and I can't login from google.,0
I have given these four star for its video and audio clearastion,2
"Good service,but takes a LOOOOT of battery, which is kinda understandable.",2
I need this for work but when i cloud call someone we can hear each other fine and i can see them but they cant see me i have a galaxy s5 sport please fix,0
This is the pure best app ever,2
Getting used to it as a host for first time,1
Its a very very nice app but some time takes time in changing the profile picture rather its a excellent app.👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻 Please enable the feature of DARK MODE on this app.,2
Its all time says chake your network even at the strong network,0
A new experience I got in this app,1
Can't see everyone on screen,1
Is there any small box for chatting? Can I chat and watch the presentation at the same time?,1
great call app,2
Nice app for meetings and personalized options are good,2
"Always crashing, that's why I found my happiness here. It's always crashing from time to time that's why I found my lover. 🙊",0
It's very good,2
Super gritchly,2
Nice,2
Nice platform for professionals,2
Volume went very low and I couldn't hear half of the presentation.,1
This is good but after some long it facing too problem .I don't know why.,0
Pls enable back ground settings,1
Had a good experience,1
Excellent,2
Overall good. However needs some UI elements to make it more intuitive,1
I was not visible to the organizer.,2
This app is good but the only problem is sometimes the buttons are not working properly and the background audio is not good as much as it is in google meet and the most important thing is this app does not have a data saving option and the mobile internet drags too much even when I turn off my camera and mute my audio also its dragging too much of data so please by the time of the next update at least solve these issues.,0
It is not gud,0
Zoom is the best meeting app I am using it for a year but now it's not connecting with my meeting fix this problem as soon as possible,2
Good,0
The app is great..!! Only function I want to be added in it is that we should be able to pin atleast 2 people at a time,1
Nice app,2
What makes this app so great is our community of positivity.,2
App works fine but my company login page has an adfs pop-up that doesn't appear when using this app...works fine on web login or iPhone,0
Nawawala ung sound 😭😭,0
Very Very poor app I have sing in and that it is against showing to sing in,0
"Other people cant hear me on the app for some reason. You cant rename yourself, add virtual backgrounds or even adjust your mic? A trash app. The pc version is much better",0
"Every time i paste something in chat, it throws me out.",1
"Audio not operating while sliding other than 2nd screen in Zoom app and also when needed to use other apps, ex: clock for the purpose of stop watch, calender etc.",1
Very good conectivity. User friendly. Voice quality was great for most of the duration of the call.,2
"Too hard to get on, too many different websites. It would be nice to just click on one site. Once on tho the quality is of the video is great.",1
Loading,0
Kept cutting in and out even though I was connected to wifi and my signal was strong. Never had this many issues with other virtual meeting platforms.,0
Nice,2
Really easy to use. My favorite is being able to transfer a meeting from my desktop to phone with no interruption.,2
Working is good. The menu is little difficult during presentation. Presenter is to change the view if someone interacts during the presentation.,2
It make me left the meeting and asking for update even update is not available,0
The audio experience was not good even the video was not clear moreover it uses so much data,1
Sometimes it glitches,1
Good,2
This app is good for meetings... but 3 starts because it is a little heavy than other meeting apps and while joining a meeting it mostly freezes.... Pls solve this problem,1
Please check to improve switching to chat and back from main window.,2
I love this. It makes staying in contact so much easier. I wish it worked better on phones though.,2
Before 2 years my online classes started in Webex that time it was pathetic but now there is alot of improvmet👍👍,2
The app became useless. Cannot join meetings. Error persists after doing all the troubleshootings.,0
😎,2
this app is kinda good but there some problems that I faced but no problem this is kinda good app nice! keep going.,2
I love this app. It's just as user friendly as the desktop app and runs just as smooth. So convenient.,2
Mirroring Screen quality rough. Meeting are more one voice capable than for a group setting.,1
"This is a very good app, it helps me on my online school and I love all the features that zoom have. but one problem is that I can't change my profile picture every time I try to change it it will change back to the old one :(( please fix this",0
My first time using this application and very pleased. I did not have any problem at all and could here the host very clear. Thank you WebEx,2
Horrible,0

"I really enjoy this app! Although sometimes it crashes and lags everything is fine. This app even helped me find my online friend of almost two years :) Thank you, zoom",2
I have to use this app for my group therapy and doctors appoinments ive had several issues with dropped calls but i understand it happends and that wouldnt have bothered me if it was just that. Recently it has begun to not even allow me in my group despite full bars on my phone. If it continues after i update i will try to reinstall but i will also drop a star. If it fixes my issues i will give a higher score.,0
"Echoed, the could not hear me unless they called me. It was a very important phone call with the doctor! Very disappointing",0

Just a simple app,2
Works fine. Just need a lot of developments in making this work faster.,1
Had a very bad experience with this app. It blows my mind that you have to download 2 apps to use same service. Functionality is not even near to Slack. This workplace is garbage. Don't ever use it or give it a shot.,0
Very good app 👍,1
I cant turn on my mic and my video in my computer i only can turn in it on my phone... Others couldn't hear me...,0
Is there any option to record the screen video or meeting recording in at least pro version,1
"It was ok just, that the audio needs to improve",1
"After downloading the app , tap on the icon but just wont open ..it flash ones every 5 seconds , try to reboot the phone but still the same .",0
"Missing functionality compared to using the web version. No screensharing, 
can't adjust settings while in a call, unable to move people around, unable 
to minimize/maximize someone (or their screen), recent doesn't show 
anything and therefore I am unable to favorite anything. Really wish it was 
full featured, especially since I pay for the pro version.",0

For the most part I love zoom. Problems: freezing up & stuttering.,2
App never really worked well. But the last 4 months I continuously get notifications and when clicking on them out takes me to nothing and showed everything as fine and updated... Uninstalled as this is now more irritating than American politics,0

good,1
I think it is pretty easy to use,1
"The app doesn't clear notifications when messages are read. Its very annoying especially for us who use it daily for work. Edit: 2 stars. When I am in a call on desktop, if I get another call, the app rings on my mobile phone. How do I take 2 calls at the same time? Also, the app sometimes forgets its supposed to be in dark mode and goes light mode by itself. Edit: 1 star. The app now keeps asking me for my login password at random times. No idea why, if its security, its terrible UX",0

Connection can get spotty sometimes when on a conference call even if you have a good signal. Otherwise app features are useful,0
"Great app, easy to use. However, you are only notified that someone has joined when the app is in use, you end up missing out.",2
"Uh, I have finally found probable reason why I have disappeared from my workplace group. There was e-mail requesting to upgrade Workplace till 7th of October.

I don't know how to fix it and it's really a disturbance to my class.

Ok,1
The sound was horrible,0
Go to meeting works great for my Dr appointments. But I wish there was a way to choose to make the video and sound turn on before the meeting starts. I am always having to waste my Dr's time fumbling around for that after the meeting starts.,2
The app was simple to download and very easy to enter a meeting. No stress at all!,2

Firstly I would like to say I'm not fluently in English. This app is really helpful for my education. But I updated Zoom app for my Laptop yesterday. So today when I was in the class that poll feature wasn't working for me. I couldn't see answer options there . I saw a half of question and long balnk page. I'm so excited. I couldn't answer for my questions.There isn't any problems. That was a great app. But now I can't say that.I want this app. However Zoom really helped me. Please fix it🙏🇱,1

I pay for the calls monthly for almost a year now and it used to be amazing... but now the app won't let me see who's on the call and it won't let me see that a call is going on to record it or anything.  If it's not fixed soon ill have to cancel my account and go elsewhere.  =(,1
The one thing I hate about this app is that I can't put a theme behind my face when I have to open the camera(I use a tablet and my friend also uses a tablet and he can change the background but I can't.),1
Hey google ummm yahhh... I really would give it 4stars but ummm while presenting screen it doesn't give the audio of the device... For some people it does give and not for others so u guys should fix this in next update..... Then II'I 4star..... EDIT:Ohk i can't open like from ur reply Nvm..... But why don't you guys make it compulsory instead of optional.....,0
I don't give even this star there is no option for any more and this the worst app I have seen and the data booming like a fire that burst for a while only 10 minutes 1.5 gb finished so I kindly request all of you to don't use the app,0

I gave this app 3 starts as there are no ads & i really like the dark mode in the new update but the reasons that i didn't give it 5 stars it..... The voice system is terrible😤 •The voice doesn't come in the starting for sometime. •During the meeting at any time the voice can drop and u can't here anything Just bcoz of wich u hv to leave the meeting and rejoin it and then presenter has to repeat everything he/she said AND you get disconected anytime.. I'd be really thankfull if u fix these bugs,1
Good,0

This is great app for meetings. Features are great.,2
"Very Interesting, Learned a lot! TU",2
It's a good app but they should fix by the now the concern about hearing the audio or the video when presenting. It can only be done on computers but not on tablets and mobile phones. I tried to do it a lot of times but it seems like you can only share the screen but not the audios of the presentation.,2
Signal is ok,2
Veri good,2
"Terrible, doesn't always work properly. Sound issues and always having to be updated.",0
Simplified online classes!!! Loved it!!,2

Bad connection,0
If I unmuted my meeting host voice is not hearing. And In call messages I can not give a personal message.My message is going for all the participants in the meetings. And In share the screen If the participants is sharing the screen my host screen is disappeared,1

Difficult for meeting leaders to navigate and control mikes. Terrible sound feedback.,1
"Overall a good app, but audio seems to consistently suffer. Muted audio seems clear, but take it off mute and all of a sudden things get static-y. I turned off high definition video and things cleared up a bit. But even with no video the audio seems to suffer on a consistent basis across meetings.",1
"I love the app. The thing tbat i woul like to be impruved is for the app to play the sounds of instrument better. When i use tibetan bowl, or drum, the ap stops the sound and does not let it go all the way❤️😊",2

It works fine.,2
"It is a good app. For a student who has to study multiple classes, the app helps organize classes keep recordings and helps me revise some lectures when I need to. It's easy to use and effective. If it is possible then can you please add playback speed to the recorded videos option, that would save a lot of time when I have to revise a lecture. I'll change my review to five star if I get that feature.",1
So nice,2

I am just 9 years old so give me more details off(how to change background on mobile devices)this will also help people using mobile devices",1
Nice,2
Share Content should be continuous.Next content should be screened simply by scrolling. Time Ltd should be unlimited . Participants Ltd should be increased to minimum 200. Video Zoom in & out facility should be added. Very important participants mobile numbers must be visible / identifiable. Host can see/ control the individual chats. Participants Videos can be on by the host.Sending emoji by participants should be controlled by the host,2
Ihappy to se this app,1

Excellent tool,2
It's good app for meetings,2

Nice experience ☺️,2
"I don't why I don't like it. Sometimes it feels complicated. Google meet is more user friendly. If you're a teacher or lecturers or organisers, just please choose different app. As participant webex is a bit difficult",1
The video and sound were not the greatest. The sound kept cutting out.,1
Nice and easy,1
It was simple and easy to use!,2

Thanks everything is perfect in this app it makes our lives more easily and simple install it and enjoy,2
It's making my phone so hot that it's difficult to hold it in the hand and I'm afraid that it will destroy the battery or make the phone explode. Please fix it as fast as possible because I have to use it in my company and I wish this application was more comfortable to use.,0

The app is good but it hangs up a lot and I can't interact to my colleagues and people cannot view my profile.,1
first of all very data consuming.... secondly Bluetooth device are not get connect easily and much more problem is about hearing audio of others !! no clarity in voice,0

Have been using this at work and with app it just got better.,2
I don't like it much,2
This app provides very extensive options and everything works well. Ever since the new CEO of Microsoft their software quality has gone up exponentially. Steve Ballmer didn't know what he was doing. I'm in school full-time and couldn't do without Microsoft products. OneNote is another one that is extremely useful in school I could put anything from pictures to documents to other files in one place.,2
Always cuts off for a few seconds when switching camera on and off.,1

I connect to the meeting schedule on Canvas, but when I click the link to open the meeting, it opens my web browser instead of the Webex app. And the page on the browser says my device is incompatible. I've even tried pasting the meeting code directly into Webex, without any luck. I'm only able to join people's personal rooms.",0
This is draining my battery in background even if it's not there,1
Very good experience to use the App. Amazing App,2
This app has recently updated the audio option but the MI cell cannot access this option . Is there any way we can also use this audio option as teacher by profession it will be very useful for sharing videos to students with audio during the sessions .,1

Easier and more professional for me. Zoom just doesn't fit my program.,2

I can't hear the sound when I'm connected to audio and I can't hear any other apps if I play while my meetings going on,0
I really like the app and it's very good. Easy to use.But i honestly think that they can improve the emojis,1
Sound from someone else's screen share stops if I turn off my screen or even go into a zoom menu. I need to use dial in audio to work around this.,1
This app is bad 😔😔,0
Still need to improve,1
"En la versión Android, es fastidioso ese menú flotante que no se puede ocultar, además que los mensajes no se quedan en el chat como su rival directo Teams, sino que ves los nuevos al conectarte si tienes fallas de conexión pierdes esos mensajes.",0

THIS APK MAKE ME VERY STRESS! BAD BITJ!!,0
"This app is an absolute mess. Not only are you FORCED to put on a phone number that's only able to be removed through an outside source (I.E Microsoft account) but the whole entire interface of this app is confusing, no clear direction to access your profile information. I had an video job interview and had issues with being able to join the conference call for 15 minutes. This is definitely going to be a one time use app. Anyone looking through the reviews and finds this, don't waste your time.",0
This app is the best app ever I had used till now. But I am giving it four stars because there is no feature to see atleast 50 person at one time.,2
"It always freezes during my daughters therapy sessions and the camera just cuts off without tapping the camera symbol. My therapist freezes but you can still hear her, thats the only way we conplete the session.",1

"You messed up a perfectly wonderful, critical meeting because participants were unable to access, knocked off the meeting site, muted when speaking, never had audio and more. In other words, you suck!",0
"This App Can't Get More Than 3 Stars . There Are Lots Of Problems While Creating Zoom Link Or Joining To It . Sometimes I Try To Join Meeting , But It Says That Host Has Not Started The Meeting ( When It Was Actully Started By Host ) Again Another Problem Is When I am In The Meeting Suddenly I Get Left From The Meeting ( Not Done By Host ) For No Reason ! Even If I Have Fast & Perfect WiFi Or Data...Again Video & Audio Problem Is Already There ! You Need To Fix This....! Thank You...!",1
I found the worst update ever and that is I am neither able to open any pdf which is being sent in the assignment nor the pdf which I had attached in it. Please look at the issue and fix it ASAP. it's not only me many are facing the same issue,1
"Horrible experience today. No video, no voice and no voice from the other attendees. First time using and most likely never try again.",0

Works great when it works like it should. Notifications won't sync with desktop lately. When I click a pop up notification on phone and it takes me to the app chat it's blank. I have to back out and back in to chat. When I click the text box to type it won't pull up. I have to back out of chat and back in. This app is required for my work so I don't have a choice but to use it. Just seems like some bugs need to be fixed.,1
Great meeting.,1
Hated the new version cause whenever I go back from meet there pops a small meet it is so so so so annoying but although it is a good app,1
I rate this 2 star because I dont have virtual background.,0
Cluttered interface. Lacks attachments sharing option,1
"Nice app , but only one problem is that we go to zoom.us links to remove our profile... so plzz add one more option for Remove Profile... and plzz try to take less data because Google meet take few data but ur app take more... but if u will not do then also it's ok. Because u have done many things for us .",1

"Am new, but grateful to be here and see how it works.",2
It just works. I have to use teams on business. I can hardly remember a problem. May be just two cases: once I had a problem using Bluetooth hands free and sometimes it asks to enter suddenly a password (and it's not very convenient in public places). Anyway I like it.,2
"On my phone, it is set to default to my actual phone speaker, the one that is used when you are holding the phone to your ear. So I have to hold my phone up to my face the whole meeting. I've tried to change this setting and can't. It's very frustrating.",0
The audio quality has really taken a hit with the last two updates. I'm hoping they improve in coming releases.,0
I don't know for some reason the app is closing by itself. Everytime I have to attend the classes I have to reinstall the app everytime. When I do that It works fine for sometime and after sometime it's again closing itself. Within 1 minute the app closes .,0
Very useful one for the teachers and students.....,1
Worst experience with mic and also screen get disappear inspite of good network connection,0
"Encountered delays in voice communication. When 4th person joined, the communication deteriorated which meant attempts to troubleshoot. I have had multiple Zoom calls with no problems., so was disappointed in GoToMeeting. But at least this is an option for face-to-face meetings.",1
Nice,2
This app is good. It has improved a lot. But i have a suggestion for this. Can you add a feature of muting a person by user side means person will be speaking but user who muted will not be able to listen only. Others can listen. A feature just like mute site in chrome but for individual person muting. Also can you keep both interfaces in app just like option for layout .,2
Nice iam joinig,0
"I have some audio problems. when i go do something outside of the app, my camera is off which can be serious trouble for moblie users like my sister and I who have strict teachers. I swear to god I am NOT lying this had happened when a device (like laptop/chromebook) is near the router and say internet is unstable. I cant put background on my chromebook on zoom. Can you fix. At least you can put any custom background you really like.",0
right ok,2
Good,2
Very good consept but the audio can be a little ropey,1
Doesn't work with Optus. My whole bloody work has changed to it. I cannot even access to take days off or see my shifts. This is the worse app ever developed. Thank you for developing your stupid app. I hate you,0
Worst,0
Why can't I use the filters?🥺,1
Too good for video communication and very easy optionals..,2
The web version doesn't work anymore. You have to download the app in your pc or mobile to use zoom. Absolutely trash. Inconvenient for low end device users like me.,0
This app gets too big. Over 250 megs of useless media people keep posting. It needs to stop caching all that on my phone.,0
The auido gets disconnected more..which is very annoying so pls check with this thing,1
Glad to be back with Google Play facebook page,1
Perfect👍💯 for the meeting,2
Can we have search options so we can find easily subjects and particular chapter. Thankyou,2
What is this it is not installing add are some many we are disturbing us it and it is waste app also and we had so many how many apps should we delete for this app,0
Not,0
Excellent vc platform,2
"Note, my current device (Nexus 6P) is officially unsupported(yet?) but the issues stated here also plagued my Nexus 5 which was not unsupported.  I've never had issues with the app itself regarding calls, quality, or performance. My main issue is when I'm not using the app. It has a persistent never-ending notification keeping me signed in long after I've ended my call. The app itself has no apparent way to prevent this and the solution I've found is to actually remove it from my recent apps list. This is far from intuitive and not in line with most app standards. The huge flaw is that it consumes battery at an alarming rate. I've had a full charge drop to 50% in 4 hours because I forgot to kill the app. I would like a setting to prevent persistence or some intelligence in the app to background itself properly. I'll gladly adjust my review when that is remedied.",0

Thank you for the response, but it should be better that the users also can choose what to see at the time of class, I found that once the organisers turn on the video it consumes lot of internet, better to have a separate option for the users to choose which screen they want to see.",0

I also need to minimize the screen cause sometimes I need to go to the other apps while my camera is on. Does this app need to update? If it is,there's no update button. My cousin have the update,lucky her...",1

"This is the worst app for meetings and school classes. All the time when I try to login it simply shows "" Connecting "" and says "" Can't Connect"" I would give a 5 ⭐ if this app was organised a bit better . Also, it is very dangerous Stupiddddddd Tell this app to shutup",0
"Google please resolve the problem, I couldn't click and view the place where it shows number of people others in Google meet because of the notifications come inside the meet. Whenever someone joins and leaves the meet, it gives the notification immediately in small white colour box inside the app itself, and this the place where I can click to view other people in meet and PIN a particular person or presentation for convenient. Hope you understand. Please please resolve this. otherwise allgood",1
The application keeps asking me to sign in even when I am signed in,0

I love' D this app until it and then I had to uninstall the app and get it back and then it said there was an air signing in and I had to get invited to the app so it made me really mad and I still haven't been able to get into it I would give it like three stars don't get it unless you can keep calm,1
The app takeing very network,0
"Thsi app is perfect but the update is not good . The last version of meet was good . When we do full screen, our icon is interrupting the video of other person. You could have added the new effects to the old version. That version was easy to handle",1

Good app,0
Can't add backgrounds or blur backgrpund for Android. Super frustrating.,0
If it is not updated it is not working so that 4 stars or else I would have given 5 . Sorry zoom team,2
It's a good option to Zoom but its screen sharing is not working at all on Android,2
Great platform! This has been a regular for me throughout the pandemic and I've never incurred an issue. Love the backgrounds also.,2

Sometimes i missed the audio and need to reconnect,2
Whoever made this app I hate you I mean it's a good app but I still hate you,1
"Not user friendly, hard to update my password and made me late signing in for my appointment.",0
Couldn't get audio to play through my phone's speaker. Audio for other speakers sometimes cut out.,0
I enjoy being on Zoom with my drawing friends. I use a tablet which has the disadvantage that I can see the drawing being exhibited only if the exhibitor is talking. If someone else speaks the screen goes to them.,2

Have this on my mobile because of company policy. It appears to be a memory hog and battery drain.,1
Super,2
Excellent intuitive conferencing. Phone calls should be simple. Uber Conference is rock solid.,2
Love it! Once in a while the app won't connect then I have to use the desktop. The quality of the calls are great. It's ability to show me who's on the line before getting on and call history are helpful tools. I can use the service equally on wifi as well as cell service.,2
Service is very very good but please make an update so that we can change background in tab also please do it as fast as you can,1
Every day.. need to put password to login into class....,0
Liked it,2
Good,2
Need calling facilities,1
It is really a nice app . When my signal is out my position use to be on same place . In other apps we are kicked out of the meeting but this gorgeous app keeps us connected until and unless we close the app 😃 .,2
"Seriously, I love this app.  I use it for work and I love getting a detailed call log afterwards via email, also love the txts that I get informing me of a scheduled call, this app is extremely useful! Also going to start using it for family stuff when we need to coordinate & texting is taking too long! Thank you!",2
Please add an option for virtual background on Android tablets and phones please 🙏🏻,2

First time user... kept freezing and breaking up however a great source for public meetings.,2
Nice app and nice updates coming and love to doing meeting,2

I love this app but the reason I gave this app only the star is when I jaidev to a free meeting for 40 minutes but it is ending the meeting before 40 minutes only,1
Very good app for classes in lokck down but 1 problem it is that you did not give option of change back ground in phone so I have a request that you add option of change backgroung in mibile phones,0
This app was very good that's why I gave 5 stars earlier but after this recent update my teacher can't hear my voice and because I'm a student online classes are very important to me if I face problems in interacting with my teacher then that's very upsetting for me please fix this problem then I can give 5 stars again like I gave before.,1
Good,1
I wish we had virtual background and all the options you can get on a desktop on your phone or tablet. I wish there was a better gallery view on the phone.,2
This app makes other apps to run in background which is visually visible and therefore it kills battery faster.,0
"Tried to have a conference several times. The attendees got the message and on to the call, but no one could hear me (the organizer) and I had nothing but hold music- even though I could see them on the call, and the timer showed an active call. Thank God I was just testing it. Uninstalling.",0
sometimes when i present something it wont have any voice.. but its good tho,1
"The option that I can change the background during meeting is missing. Please Do fix it, thanks",1
"I am unable to reduce the volume... It is automatic and fixed. Volume is same for earphones as well as speaker mode, which is very annoying and disturbing",0

Extremely good app. Highly recommended especially for online class meetings . Got a hundred times better after the update for Android tablets. It will be more better if you could add the recording feature for Android tablets.,2
"Ok, sometimes a little Lag and slow",2

I cannot turned on my video during my exams when I tried to turned on still the video is not showing please try to fixed this problem,0
It is too good app,2
No doubt it is very good and interactive app but the problem is data consumption. It consumes lot of mobile data while using the app and for a student with limited mobile data it creates problem. After 3 hours lecture we get 300mb remaining. Can you do something on it.,1
This updated is stupid if i zoom it will go up I like the old ones STUPID UPDATE!!!,1

It has very much network issues in my class my ma'am voice not come or video. Please not download this app,1
GoToMeeting is easy to use and reliable. I'm a very satisfied customer.,2
No clarity of video and the voice is not visible,1
"It has many glitches. I have 5 periods of 40 min each and by attending them, my 3 gb data gets over everyday.",0
Seems to work okay but the picture quality isn't great.,2
"It's a decent app for meetings. Used it for a birth class. Cut in and out a bit at times, probably more due to network connectivity. It is a bit fussy with video being show and having the audio come through for those, we ended up skipping a lot of videos due to this. All in all it works. I like that it has the chat and raise hand feature to let the host know you've got a question without a lot of audio interruption.",2
The lighting in this update seems to be darker than the previous one.,0
"Have been using this application for an year. And it has so damn easy interface. Just the audio connection takes time when we switch network. But otherwise, everything is perfect.",2
Good,2
"Seems work ok but the update keeps stalling , the pictures are pretty clear audio needs adjusting, but good app.",1

UX/UI is still much clumsier than Zoom,1
Good app,2
Very Convinient.,2
This isnt really I was expecting and I think you guys should recieve 3 stars only... I never have given a applocation ★★★ stars... The reason I gave 3 ★★★ because Whenever I am reading a school textbook online... I am getting disconnected everytime. my teacher is now fed up and thinks that I have bad internet connection still I have unlimited for my school... So... Also if I clicked leave by mistakly then I automatically get disconnected for a stupid reason. plz solve the issue...,1

It is very helpful because I can join my class but sometimes my sound can't hear to the meeting,2
Meh- i wanted to use this as a shortcut to call into meetings but if I don't personally have an account (my company obviously does) it doesn't let you use most of the features like saving the meetings or creating a reminder.,0
I have very good experience on Google meet because whenever I attend my online classes I feel that I am sitting in my school classroom . I like wallpaper option on Google meet app because we change wallpaper at any time . So thank you for making this app .,0

"According to my perspective, Microsoft Teams is an excellent app and meeting platform for schools, Colleges, and office work. In laptops and computers,teams work perfectly. But when it comes to mobiles and tablets, all the options and features in the laptops are not there. Backgrounds are not accessible in mobiles. There is a little scope of improvement which Microsoft can provide.otherwise,teams is an excellent app.",1
I have a very bad experience with this application whenever I try to join the meeting it seems network problem which is a bad thing to do with the class,0
Worst video conference app,0
"Okay, so first of all, is the app an absolute life saver for Pandemic online meetings, Maybe yes...And also no....There are so many updates and the updates are making the app even worse and typically hard to use..So would be better if the next update contains the Google Meet that we used on Feb or March 2020 but with the new features...So it would give us a nostalgic type feeling and new features too... Thank you, please reply me with the name ""Kabir""",1
A great app. I attend all my classes during lockdown using this app . It's a great help,2
Very functional and useful app. UX can be improved. Crashes when switching between apps. Less responsive compared to competing apps.,1

"I don't use Zoom on Android often, but as much as I do, it seems pretty crash-prone, especially when interracting with the chat during a meeting (for example, when trying to copy a message).",1
Very good app but reason for the four star sometimes a little bit of lag and can't on video or audio of app problem .,2
"The app connects faster, has clearer audio and video, and is easier to use than the desktop app/browser version (probs depending on connection and device but of course it is). Not five stars because there's nothing special about it that like, ""wow""ed me. But it's really, really good for exactly what you need it for. EDIT: minus an extra star because about 30% of the time I lose all audio after about 15 minutes and spend that time talking to no one and hearing nothing.",1

"Sometimes, my Microsoft Teams is crashing. I suggest that you should put private chats that is sent to the presentors for meetings so that the other people who has concerns can be addressed. Also, so that the other shy students that are not comfortable in chatting publicly can have recitations that are sent to the teacher. I hope this can be addressed and I hope this suggestion can be put already. Thanks!",1
"No matter how many times I restrict and prevent background data and ram usage in my phone's actual settings, Workplace just keeps on going. As soon as I deleted the app, my phone jumped in speed. Heck, it's probably been the cause of my phone's severe battery drain for the last few weeks, too! I'll stick with the desktop site from now on when at work. Facebook kills everything it touches with just so much bloat and so many glitches. Their general creepiness is also a reason for deletion.",0

Good and informative. But meeting should have started as scheduled. 20 mins delay is too late and Time is very precious to all,1

I'm fully updated and using a Chromebook that was released late 2019. When using the Chrome extension, it's a little better in terms of staying in the actual meeting, however the response time is much slower. Otherwise easy to use and intuitive. If I could hold a class from beginning to end without crashing I'd give it 20 stars.",0

sometimes we get technical issues otherwise it's perfect but in our school some students come with fake names and start bullying us in chat so it would be nice if we could trace them out if possible I request the creators of this app to provide this facility sometimes we automatically leave the class it's too irritating and presenter is changed by our frnds so notes stops in between.,1

"Old meet was better , when I want to go to chrome to classes , it won't let me! I can't press a single button , mobile version is horrible ,",0
This app gave me no issues. I only wish that the presenter could see each person at the same time just as the attendees could. If this option was available then I couldn't figure it out. The sound and video quality was very clear.,2
Great!,2
"Everything was smooth except it was a bit tough figuring out how to get on as once I registered I expected an email with a direct link, but didn't receive one. So I re-registered and realized I needed to put in a password.",2
When peopel leave the meeting it makes an audible noise that is a little distracting. Great app aside from that.,1
It's just an poor app I have online classes on this app and you know my device just hanged and I have to restart it it's new device but then also I hope developers will see this review and please make it better😠😓😅👋,0

Dear zoom developers its my humble request to you that please add recording and setting virtual background options in this application for mobiles and tabs... I hope you can add the option. Exept that the application is awsome.... I'll give 5 stars after the options are added,1
Better than google meet,2
Nice,2
I have an android and during the meeting it flips back and fourth from everyone trying to talk; it's annoying. Good thing i don't have epilepsy. Apparently the iPhone version doesn't do that and has seperate boxes for each person. If the android version does have that option please let me know how to change it.,0
It would be better to place the raise hand icon in the main display of zoom app. It's a little bit hassle if it takes up to 3 presses before we can activate it.,0
1. No option edit meeting layout. Current layout is not user friendly 2. No option to annotate on shared screen 3. Switching between private chat and public chat is hectic. It should be controlled via simple @ symbol 4. Meeting takes lot of time to launch when URL is used. Many times it fails as well 5. Current speaker window should be overlayed on shared screen. Lot of screen is wasted in current layout making it difficult to see in small screens,0

I like this app very much.I think that this application is much better than the Google meet and Zoom.It is much better to do online Class and that's why I am ratting this app 4 stars.

Voice is breaking and incoherent..... Often even though network is OK..... There are lot of pauses in audio..... Please rectify.,1
I don't know if my english was broken or not but I hope Google Meet can improve the notifications of people left the meeting and enter meeting to other side or other place 😂😂 Because it is really annoying when I'm watching my lecturer notes with that kind of notification. Please do not cover my lecturer presentation with that notification. I hope you resolve it . I will always appreciate if you could take my request to change it as soon as possible❤️,2

Finally, I miss the menu of options that appears at the top of the screen in the PC version--without it, I don't think I can annote or give control. This has similar features to my iPad app, so I assume this is the Android phone version of Webex...please update for Chromebooks!",0

"This app is a disgrace in comparison to desktop experience, and a reason why I would recommend away from Uberconference, as its mobile experience is still quite poor. 3 main reasons: 1) I have to login somewhere to use it. No login of any kind is needed on Desktop, unless you are hosting. It's cumbersome. 2) Opening a conference link in the app does not take you to the conference.  You have to type the conference name in. At least if you had to login in the process. 3) May be there is VOIP support, may be there isn't (yes, I heard rumors there was). I didn't dare find out. The app gives you stern warnings that it needs your phone number, and it will dial in to the conference, which is assigned a US number. Providing the phone number is not an option, as well as not giving the app dialing permissions. I am abroad, I'm on roaming, I don't want to incur international voice charges. If there is a VOIP mode, then those at most should be optional, as I have no assurances that the phone won't dial me into the conferences, plus the app outright tells me it will. (this was expanded as original was typed up on the phone, right after the experience, and as a mean to reply to the Developer).",0
"I gave 4 stars because, there's a bug that it makes my device blinking any time so can you please fix this bug so that I can do online class properly ☺️",2
It made meetings very easy and comfortable.No need to waste time by typing password too.But the video not much clear.Recording facility is not there.But it is the best way to talk each other and chat.In my view it is for study purpose.,2
Hang vedio audio,0
Very good app,2
Great app. Helped me alot. My laptop had failed so I download the app on my phone and attended the meeting with no problem at all. Many thanks for the initiative.,2
Very effective app for training,2
I can't get the app to work seems like rubbish to me,0
Some good features but limiting in many ways,0
"By forcing me to update the app before allowing me to connect to an important meeting (instead of just offering an ""update later"" option), Webex has made me late and hurt my business relationships.",0
My zoom always freeze during the 1st few minutes. Aftwards it is fine.,1
The audio sucks. I can't understand what people are talking about via phone. So bad. It's annoying to use it via phone,0
"Lovely App, great quality calls, and user-friendly. A neat App overall.",2
Decent app but I will ALWAYS rate a 1 star if I tell you I don't want to rate your app and you keep forcing me to answer the question. This practice needs to stop and this is my small part to help it.,0
Nice app after update thank you microsoft teams Now I can take classes very nicely.Teams please help me when I forgot to update app the teams features does not work properly.So in the teams give a feature that when their is a update it will notify us,2
"Would give more stars if everytime someone else that was a part of the group made a sound, such as their dog barking it switched to them, it made it almost impossible to get to watch while my daughter was the one getting her certificate. Very big disappointment. Although I believe it was mostly disrespectful of the other parent to not have muted their feed. I think that there should be an option to only view one particular feed instead of the one making the most noise at the time.",0
"I had to unistalled the app twice. Not using right now. The reason being that the check green mark indicating ""available"" does not synchronize with the app on my computer when I log off/in at work. In the phone app, I am available 24/7 unless I manually change the settings. It is cumberson to have to change it back and forth as I leave / arrive work every day.",0

"I have inexplicably disconnected from meetings far too many times over the course of a year. There were times that I can understand why I suddenly dropped from a meeting (I left the app and kept it open for too long while my phone settings specifically closes standby apps running in the background), but more often than not, I just disconnect with no discernible cause. I have looked for solutions before, yet nothing lasted.",0
"The only downside, if any, is the phone I use! It's not the best so the app probably can't reach it's full potential. Aside from that tho, it's great!!",2
"Use teams for work and it is good. Share screen, voice call, video chat, send file, create groups etc., I am using this more than outlook nowadays. One issue is it needs microsoft authenticator, which some times has problems. Especially when changing work password.",2
"You sent out an e-mail three times to re-establish my password they never arrived. I checked spam, etc. Video was established but no sound. I finally got a link and connected by using my cell phone.",0
I don't even want to give one star. No video clarity and audio is very clumsy,0
Great app was working fine until recently no one in work will get notifications until hours later sometimes even a day or two later. Most people miss a lot of important details we need for the day.,2

Nice app,0
This app is awesome to meet friends and family online. But it would be much better if there is access to virtual backgrounds and have good video clarity(Brightness ect.) in android tabs and phones. This will not only be good for me but for all those people using zoom in android. The next problem is that sometimes it's shows incorrect password even if the password is correct. This had happened to most of my classmates and also causes a delay to the entire class. Please solve the problems.,1

Wish I could give 4.9 This was just in order to point out my view. It even does not glitch in any of the devices!",2
Very nice,2
"It worked out pretty good the first time, after that nothing but audio. My case worker was wanting to set up meetings through the VA but it doesn't seem to be working, she wants to see our faces to make sure we are doing alright during this covid-19. Making sure we keep up with our meds and appointments at the VA. We have special meetings every three months and a hand book once a year. It's supposed to make it easier for the vets and there case workers to get together. I got on the first time .",1
Most imperfect software I don't know why my office has taken your service. Your app kills our mobile by heating it like anything. You don't have recording option Your Connectivity is terrible compared to other competing application. Pathetic software.,0

Like when I click on it, it load like normally but when the loading is finished, nothing, nothing appears on the screen and I can't even reclick on the documents, please fix this as soon as possible I need it for school",2
"Works for conference calls. If you are having a video conference call on the android app, the screen only shows the video of the mic talking. With 6 people the screen flashes between pics so much that it gives you a headache. I have heard the apple app allows you to see all people (up to 6) on the screen at once. Please fix the android app to do the same.",1

Thank goodness for Microsoft teams too help keep everyone connected especially when working virtual.,2
It's a really nice app especially for online classes but I can't change the background in my phone can anyone please tell me why is that not working in my phone,1
"1) The shared content can be put on the left and the participants on the right part of the screen. 2) Zoom participants should be able to mute other participants. However they should not be able to open the camera of other participants. 3) Hosts can be able to download the list of participants, together with the time they entered and got out. 4) A place within Zoom should be created where hosts will be able to conduct exams etc, put marks and receive exam papers or essays through the app.",2
A legacy of hating the customer.,0
"Sometimes drop audio, why",0
"Two stars for it connecting a couple people together, but honestly the experience was pretty bad. Volume levels spiked and dropped randomly, people would suddenly be muted for no reason, the video feed kept resizing and mostly disappearing off the side of the screen, no option to switch camera, and controls felt very clunky. It does work, mostly, but there are much better options out there.",0
App is not working properly with most of the Bluetooth headsets.,0
Good,1
This is an great app and very useful Only one thing which i would say is please do something about the virtual background option. It is supposed to show but it is not showing please look into it. This virtual background is really important for me and please see to solve this. Thankyou,1

User interface is very irritating to use. The entire page refreshes every time one opens any page and takes time to load despite fast internet.

Nor does it provide any preview.,1

Nice app✨,2
"GoToMeeting is simple, easy to use, and works. It's the gold standard that apps should follow.",2
"It's a really good app to study and online class. I just don't like the camera issue. If I open my camera, my WiFi will be slow and I will be very lagging. Please let the camera require more less WiFi is I won't be lag when class. My teacher just told my mum I didn't open my camera. I didn't open my camera cause it will cause me so lag. I hope you will fix it as fast as possible. Thank you.",1
The app is useful for online class make that we can on video while in home screen and the participants can screen share when the host allow,1

"In some mobile phone,virtual background can be changed.mine is unable to do it though my software is updated and use the latest OS.",1
microphone doesn't work when my earphones are plugged in.,0
Great app works perfectly with our work meetings works on all platforms.,2
The app works well mostly - I would love it if messages I opened on desktop would disappear from notfications on mobile though! And sometimes it takes a while to sync (have to go in and out of conversations). Other than that I'd give 5 stars.,2
Audio on the app (and the desktop version) is always funky. Output to headphones vs speakers gets all mixed around,1
it was an educational and inspirational experience for me. it was what I expected from earlier chats with the two lead in gals before Zach. I appreciated zach's go to meeting as it put the whole picture before my eyes. I came away with a total understanding of the operating system as an employee. I also fully understand the weekly pay process with month end bonuses based on sales above or below the $600 base pay level. the items I will sell to consumers will be akrwady ready at the store sites.,2
"I wasn't expecting a 1 on 1 meeting to have me muted by default, but that's good for privacy at least. Room for improvement. Maybe when first connecting to a session (especially by first time users) it could be more obvious that the mic is muted? My first session failed to connect, I chose retry and it failed to connect again. Closed app (manually) and chose join button (from emailed invitation link) again. This time the app opened and connected correctly. Fast load time",2
Huge problem of sign in,0
Super app love it😊😍,0
Didn't work,0
"Whenever i connect my earphones or headphones in the middle of meeting, the voice didn't come in the earphones or headphone it's coming from the mobile speaker in my device. Kindly remove this bug. My device is ""Realme 2"". I have to disconnect from the meeting and then connect the earphone or headphone and then join the meeting to listen the meeting in earphones which is not feasible.",0
Thank you for support!,2
Very informative andentertaining,0
App is good but has lost of flaws which need to be fixed,1
I don't understand why people think this app is so bad. Its perfect!!!!!!!! I guess the only downside is that there is isn't a virtual background at least for mobile it doesn't work but good app btw Google classroom copy u edit:this app sucks u that Samsung users too badly,2

"Great App. I use it weekly for my classes. I just attended a meeting also, and it was great. Thank you!",2
"The app is fine, but one MAJOR PROBLEM that is spoiling my experience is that the option of changing speed while hearing recorded videos has been removed. This is a basic yet important feature, and is offered by all other similar apps like Zoom, etc. Please bring it back.",1
Great and useful product,2
Handy to have on my phone. Clarity depends on your signal. But in general this app works very well.,2

"1.I am higher secondary school student. So,this app is good for learning purpose. Because of this pandemic we are learning through Google meet. From my experience it is pretty good app!

Unfortunately you can't login with your Google account although in the website you can.,0

Thanks to introducing us such a nice app I did not get any disturbance from the app so I have gave it 5 stars,2
Ping issue in zoom only sometimes,1
It is useful but whenever we minimize the video from another app it can't hear audio in the group.So my request is that whenever you update then you just see my problem.And we can't record the session which have taught in it,0
Bad,0
Meet is very use ful app,2

why can't I use change background effect? I'm using Samsung A6+ and I believe that it's higher than Samsung S9 which is the recommended device to use the effects. Please I needed it.,1
Very positive so far. And then fact that Ms supports a Linux client is extremely positive in the opinion of a huge user base. Many technical users prefer Linux workstations and that's a huge every growing group.,2
Not a bad app. Has some problems like taking a lot of time to connect to audio and so on.,1
Audio not proper,0
Please let there be an option to disable auto rotate in the app. It's annoying. Other than that 5*,1

Can't join meeting,0
"UberConference HD has a good clear sound as long as there is only one voice. It picks up only one sound/voice at a time and there is a pause between voices so often words are missed. The first several times we used it, there was no difficulty connecting or with the controls. The last two times have been crazy. Some people are muted and we cannot unmute them. It suddenly dropped the host call tonight, the time before this, it refused to accept the host call, we had to call in as a participant.",2
This app is not getting installed in my phone model No real 2,0
"My experience with this app is as good as the internet connection. I would rate it as acceptable, since I also think Americans rely too heavily on anything other than face to face communication.",2

feedback to others in meeting. Headset doesn't cause issues in skype, as an 
example.",1
"I just increased 1 star and would have given 1 more too, only if the cost involved was not that much. Any which ways, previously I had put up a query instead of a review and now I am replying my own query here.

Please add person chat option during meeting.,0
Mera mike nahi chall raha ak mahina se mane to complain bhi nahi sudhara raha,0
This App can get terrible sometimes. Imagine it probes you for your email address that you duly key in as required and then the system indicates that the said email address is unknown to it. This also applies to my mobile number as well. You are left with no choice other than un installing the app and to download it afresh. In the meantime you lose out time on your meeting. These shortcomings should be fixed ASAP!,0

"The app disconnects if you try and multitask on your phone. GoToMeeting has to be open and in the foreground for it to work. If you minimize GoToMeetings or open another app, it will disconnect you from the meeting. Pretty useless. You might as well use the call-in option.",0

Awesome 👍😊,2
This app has proven to be very efficient and very useful. There's very rarely any issues with video or audio quality except those sometimes caused by users on very bad internet connections. It's also very easy to set up. I would say this is a game changer for multiple point video communications the same way Skype was for cheap/free audio communications.,2

"I Installed this on my WiFi Nexus 7 tablet but then quickly uninstalled due to the fact that this app will only support connecting by using paid Skype credit (or a 'Mobile Data' option, which did not work on my Nexus).  This app also really needs a 'Mute ALL' feature for larger calls.  I suggest that UberConference also provide the same quality VoIP support for mobile devices that they provide for the desktop/browser client. Until then, this app will remain uninstalled...",1

It was a nightmare to get it to work after I switched phones. Authenticator wouldn't work and the only way I could get it to work was I had authenticator on my old phone so I was able to use the generated number there.

"Overall this app is user-friendly and good, but I would like to suggest one thing that it will be good if the host or admin of the meeting can watch the Email IDs of all the participants on the screen, because sometimes some participants are there who enter the meeting with multiple profiles (but with single Email ID as it's attached with Google Calendar) to create disturbances and the host can only see the names but not the Email IDs.

"I am stuck in an endless loop of apparently my account not existing but I can get a reset code to get into my account that still doesn't exist when I try. There is no option to create a new account with this and no place to ask for help or troubleshooting so I am stuck. I would never bother with this app because of this if it wasn't for my lawyer insisting on it until 40 minutes of trying to get in, we end up doing a telephone call.",0
"Awful! Looked good and sounded good, but terrible functionality! Nothing worked! No one saw my questions and I had no access to the chat.",0
"Good app. Replying to individual messages ispossible in mobile app. However not available in desktop app. Having it on desktop will be quite useful.

Service is very slow.,1
It works. Not as feature rich as other apps. I still use alternative communication apps because Teams doesn't do all the things I want to do or enterprise doesn't have Federation with all my contact companies.,1

My experience is good .I just want to say that zoom can be very good . if this app did not have some discomfort and problems .it is five 🌟 but I give four star the cause of the sound problems. I usually have this problems when I attend in the big meeting. So I hope this app can be good in zoom cloud I've also tried the government one I cant get in because I am not the government someone,2
Firstly the app download and asking for registration when I completed all my username and password then it says you're mobile is not compatible . it's very funny this app is only interested in your contacts not in your work. I think it is fishing app.,0

So we tried this app and unfortunately the video quality is just atrocious. Our internet speed is well within range works with others like doxy. Me no problem there. We tried to group using the app as it says oh my God it was horrible the stutter between the video and the audio is just really terrible. There's no way a person can use his for video conferencing and real-time it doesn't work in real time.,0
I could see myself and none of other attendees. Forced join meeting only by one attendee calling my cell phone very disappointing,0

Google meet is nice but there are many issues I cant share properly and google meet hangs a lot I have to rejoin 4 to 5 times and the camera is also blurry even I dont have any connectivity issue then also......,0
I'm loving the power of collaboration that Teams makes possible. I would give it 5 stars if we could get Google Calendar and Teams calendars to sync,1
Its laging so much,0
Some times the app starts lagging. In case you can solve this issue than it is the best app.,2
"Bit of a lag in terms of notifications coming through compared to desktop, but other than that it works well. I find that teams audio can be better than a phone call in areas with poor coverage.",2
Good for everyone,2
"Fix your app. Everytime I enters the code and password manually to join a meeting, it always leave automatically; always connecting.",1
Great app to have meetings in. I like that i can turn the screen off and still hear the content of the meetings!,2
Very easy to contact our friends.very nice& useful app.,0
As I constantly update the application I find that the application consumes a great volume of data especially during online classes of my daughter and mine as a teacher. This issue needs to be resolved.,1
If you can't allow Android users to join existing meetings then don't provide an Android app at all.,0

"Two major dislikes for me: • Can't upload more than 1 image at a time via the mobile app. • Can't move items from one folder to the next via the mobile app. Of course there is a work around for moving files that requires toggling to the mobile web browser, setting it to desktop mode, than performing a press and hold to bring up the dialog box. Pain in the butt realistically. No work around for the posting bulk images or files. Still requires 1 by 1. This is my biggest issue.",0

Pretty easy to navigate. Only wish there was an easier way to make sure you are not being recorded visually and with the sound as well. Especially when you don't want to be. There's a possibility that the app will mute/unmute and record/not record without you even knowing it. Please Fix!,2
Works great! There is a problem with T-Mobile users. There is a charge being made per minute to access the conference. Depending on what state you call from the charge varies.,2

"Video is fuzzy and audio is a bit delayed. My main complaint is that I cannot see more than 3 participants, besides myself, on screen, at any time, nor can I easily change their order. This despite having 4-7 other participants online. Disappointing and frustrating. Wish my moderator would use Zoom instead. 3 months on and no improvement.. in fact, all of the above complaints have gotten worse... Hating this app.",0
"Unethical means of marketing by the company. Fake job interview calls and link to download the app. Worthless, unethical, immoral way of marketing.",0
Great though sound disturbs a little.,1
Needs improvement The mobile version does not allow me to Set a Meeting WITH a password. I have to use PC version if I want a meeting with a Password. For.some stupid reason I have to enter the Password twice: to set a meeting and again TWICE to start a meeting. Why?? Waste of time. Discord offers more powerful features and better audio and video quality.,1
I am madly angry with this app. I lost an opportunity because of its inconvenience. I installed it and trying to open the link given to me but Everytime I click on join button nothing happens. Not recommendable to use for a meeting.,0

When I tried to login to the app from my samsung tablet SMT230 it said bad network n cannot login. Then when i connected the tablet to mobile data n again tried to connect to the app it still didn't work. Also when I finally logged into the app from my smart phone I still had issues with network and had lots of video n audio loss inbetween the meeting. Thus I overall experience was not satisfactory.,1
Ok,0
"Until now it was great, but recently it just gives me network issues and when I was listening to the class it got disconnected and showed unknown error, it's been happening recently. I am very angry 😡 please change it",1
I have enjoyed my usage. NIce experience with this app.,2
"Wish more people on my organization used this. Collaboration becomes passive instead of active, you can work together in pieces throughout the day instead of needing a 40 minute meeting to decide on something stupid simple.",2
In new update there is problem....when we get phone call while meeting and then after completing call if we continue the meeting again......... meeting host did't recieve voice from other participant and it becomes only one way communication....I hope so this problem will be solve so I can give you 5 star rating....,0
The voice and visuals kept breaking.,0
No video calling option and if a copy of recorded call can be emailed upon request within a certain time period will be a good option. I would recommend it.,0
Not working and very lie matter,0
5 star app but before this new update. In this new update we can't mute other fellow's mic . Some time we forget to mute our mic after a conversation than our personal talks are broadcasting in whole meeting. Before any of fellow mate could mute it for us if we are not aware . But now it's not possible in this new update . Google nobody is gonna mute his boss in a meeting they are all sensible people attending meet. Its not a dating app. For stop misusing this you can just show a notification,0
I can't change my background pls enable it,1
IT IS VERY GOOD👍👍,2
Easy access for group meetings,0
the only problem with zoom is while showing any video through YouTube there's no sound in it. wen using zoom through phone..so you need to fix this problem.. otherwise no sense in giving this option...rest is perfect...a complete app for any online work.... excellent,2
Cant hear the person talking it keeps breaking up when I am trying to do a review for a test!!,0
I use it for work but cannot attend non work meetings without signing into work! Zoom doesn't have this issue,0

"It is a good for studying but nowday so many students are facing network issues . Such as ,When we are joining the meeting it is showing Connecting... And then it disconnected shoeing Error code 104104 . And we are. Unable to join the meeting . Please solve this problem as soo as possible otherwise we are unable to study .",0
"After recent upgrade for showing pinned chats at the top, a list of other chats just disappeared. But if you unpin all your chats, the regular ones get back again. So, the way to get it working is to not use pin chats. Amazing! You change companies quadrillions doublones for your products and release bugs constantly. The funniest thing is that you can't contact support directly in case of issue, you have to ask your organization' administrator for it.",0
Improve connection setting...,1
Good,2
"While the app is helpful, my teammates and I have the issue of not getting notification when we were supposed to. This caused us to miss important messages from others in the team.",1
sweet,2
"Love the clarity and audio of the meetings, and using it for several purposes.",2
"The mobile app has quite a lot of bugs. 1. You cannot see if the person in front has a microphone in his device. 2. If there is a call the meeting would be on hold (and members get info of that) but after you end up call, the mute button is automatically switched off showing that you are on unmute.",1

"I enjoyed every meeting here on zoom because of its good features but now the real problem is coming in notice. Whenever i chat during the meeting, and when i come back to the normal screen it turns black and cannot see what our teachers are doing. Please try to fix it as soon as possible.",1
I don't know how people work without it! What do you do to discover each other's work?,2
This application is awesome but the developers should bring the Virtual background option for Android as well.,2
The first thing is when i join a meeting i have get to the ppt but whenever i close the meeting whitout ending meeting i can't get out from this app please fix this silly problem its not silly actually its a big problem its only happening in my mobile android vivo 1724 fix it,0
"There is some problem in zoom sometimes when we try to join the meeting other shows the error, and we try to sign in the zoom with email and password still it doesn't sign in.. Thankyou..",1
I've been facing audio issue since Last 3 weeks so please fix this glitch as it creates interruption when you're in an important meeting and can only be fixed when you rejoin it.,0
"This app is great, I use this for online class to by the way, and if you turned in your assignments something funny or cute animations will pop up on your screens! 😆",2
When we redirect from notification it will be bufferring with good connection also. We have to go back and again open chat then it works. And there is no sync between notification when we view from desktop.,2
Okkk,2
"MEET IS GETTING WORSE, LOOK AT UI IT WAS BEST IN THE OLD VERSION & MID VERSION AND NOW LOOK AT THE UI SPECIALLY THE RAISE HAND BUTTON, IT'S EVOLVING BACKWARDS ON ANDROID. Edit:- Review stars are updated from 1star to 3stars because it has less features on android.",1
The experience I had with WebEx it's a bit shaky it works really good I think you could use some improvement and as far as the court experience goes not a huge fan of Adams County however the judge is very nice hopefully I can get this matter resolved fairly quickly,1
"I really find the app really useful for my teaching purpose at University level. However, I have a big issue with the app. I am replacing my laptop with my Android phone. All office apps, browser, etc...work seamlessly, specially together with Samsung's Desktop solution DEX. Unfortunately, Zoom does not allow an external USB Camera to be used as video input on the Android App. I have done some research and I found out that technical there is no problem and that it is as easy as granting access.",1
"Great. But can you add toilet (🚽) button so students can just notify host, instead of chatting or telling it to the whole class?? 😅😅😅 thank you.",2
What is with this annoying always on notification? Unbelievably annoying. Immediately uninstalled. Doesn't even go away when you sign out!,0
"Very nice ... As my opinion it is a little expensive but is very comfortable to use Basically the amount of money worth it . This can be only use for educational and work purpose ... Because for family and friends it is expensive . For family and friend you should use duo , zoom and whatsapp video call Duo is best for family and friends And teams is best for work or school . This is a honest comment Should try teams ... Very nice for work or school",2
Always Crashed and leaving from a current meeting and can't login again so every time i have to reinstall it...Really disgusting...,0
This nice app but my microphone is not working i always go to settings and disallow the microphone and then i atend the meeting in the meeting only i give the permission to allow meet to use my microphone then it work sometimes,1
"Not able to join the meeting thru Oneplus 7pro. It does not ask for passcode mostly. Even if it asks sometimes, jumps back to ""join the meeting"" option on entering the passcode. Very pathetic experience.",0
Please do consider for other Android phones like Realme to have its virtual background. It will be very helpful for every users using this app and hoping to have this request as soon as possible. Thank you,1
Good,2
Awesome after my successful enrollment,2
"It's a good app,must say .But the only problem with it is that whenever I join from one of my phone, And I try to unmute.. Nobody is able to hear.. It's not that there is problem with my phone's microphone or something because it's alright in other apps like zoom, etc.. but only on WebEx , I am not able to unmute..And I always have to connect Bluetooth for making the others hear what I am saying.. and sometimes in case, I don't have the bluetooth or any other device, It's a disaster for me..😢",2
"On android, my keyboard cuts into the text space so I cannot see what I'm writing. Constantly have to close the keyboard to double check what I've written, is annoying to use the app.",1

"Can't log in, opens Microsoft log in page, details don't work there either. Waste of time. To be honest, if its anything to do with Facebook I'm not interested anyway.",0
"Whatever happened in the latest update has utterly destroyed any usability of teams on Android. Only pinned chats seem to be visible. I have to use the search function to find other chats. Shifts barely worked previously, now it doesn't at all. Given the way the world is now, the quality of this app is unacceptable from one of the worlds biggest players. I recommend you only use desktop or web teams. Android app is useless. If I could give less than 1 star I would.",0

Awesome to take work on the go! However.....extremely annoying to constantly have the login prompt appear when I'm NOT working from my phone. I tolerated it for the sake of hoping an update would fix...but for as little as I need to use on my phone - I'll just install from the app store next meeting I have to go mobile.,0
It's a good app but when I open another apps I automatically leave my meeting.... Please give a solid solution to this.........,1
A lot of audio issues and dropped calls. Great platform when it works but seems to be happening more and more.,0
Overall it is a great app. But sometimes I get this issue that I can not join the meeting and by chance even when the host let's me in the meeting it still disconnects me.And I don't even get audio and visual signal.,0
Not running smoothly,2
"It was very okay at first,but now,even after updating it and even connecting with more than enough data it won't connect.",0

A call to support (and a bad review here) brought quick response, which is appreciated. After three months of multi-point use: this is a solid high-quality software. Good audio quality, and is given priority. Quick focus switching when someone starts speaking. Facilities for all the usual videoconferencing features. Kudos to developers.",2

A very good experience talking and seeing family far away!,2
More effective i need,1
Love it,2
The meeting is getting disconnected itself. Also my mic doesn't work when earphones are connected. Expect better from Google.,0
Difficult to use. For a mobile app the number of prompts to join a meeting is ridiculous and a recurring problem is after joining the meeting WebEx will fail to call you leaving you without an audio connection. This is junk.,0
Good. App,2
"Very Innovative way of reaching out with colleagues and doing business. Also, in attending workshops. Nothing can beat this app.",2
Poor Audio,1
"Worst app. Only 4-5 features like video, audio, screen sharing, chat. No list of participants, number of participants, private chat, etc.",0
Just share info using tech with my colleageus,2
This is really a good app but there is no effects or background . So I give only three stars,1
Good,2
When I am using app join a meeting I can't hear anything I am doing wifi or cellular data and again an again my phone is switching off and on worst app in the world,0

Always tells me the website certificate has expired. Wont connect to audio. I have to uninstall then install again for it to work but after a few uses goes back to doing the same. But now it wont connect propery after doing this.,0
Best experience and very easily with academic classes,2
This app is consuming too much data,0

Can i go live& get notifications?,2
Awesome communication,2
Excellent service,2
Good one!,2
This app is really good but how can I send documents while am already in the meeting like for example how can I send notes to the organizer of the meeting on this app ??? You see at school today we were told to send work to the organizer of the meeting but I really don't know what to do can you help me out,2

No landscape option. Going from car mode back to regular mode the visual that was being presented cannot be seen again.,1
"Photos, &video voice is not recived clarity",0
"Works well except chat doesn't allow you to go straight to chat, makes you go to all chats first and then individual",2
"The app is overheating and draining battery during call. This isn't a device-specific concern, because Zoom or Skype don't do such things.",1
Inability to cut off camera and mic before joining a meeting drew some very unwanted attention rejoining in a noisy environment. Ability to stay connected when shifting from WiFi to LTE is very poor leading to the above issue.,0
This is good app but there are few problem the video get stuck and the audios are breaking and in next update plz be sure to make mssg option in app plzz☺️,1
Quality of audio was hit and miss about 50 % of time.,1
Very nice app for meeting hall,2
Gooddddd,2
It took a while to get into the meeting even though I was there on the page they could not hear me that was a waste of 10 to 15 minutes the speaker needs to be recalibrated so that we can clearly hear and understand as each person is speaking with more clarity it took a while for us to get acclimated to the page but we got there.,0
Everyone listen i really didn't like this app at a tall because it is so confusing app if you agree please do yes and not then sure do no as your wish guys,0

App is good but some features need to be added so that we can communication becomes easier. Signal strength (ping) indicator feature should be added so that we know other person is having problem with his network. And let him know that in this way I believe communication becomes easier,1

Good,1
Super Google meet,1
Awesome for larger groups. I just wish there was a function to allow for people to be next in line for comments. Trying to talk and being talked over and apologizing with lag time makes it difficult to discuss in an orderly fashion.,2

I had a very good meeting using this app.,2
It's a task for me to make my customor's join audio for the meeting. Please make it more simpler to connect to audio in the meeting as it wastes a lot of time to call them up and show them how they can connect to audio.,1

Can't open the uploaded lecturer files in assignment . Worst. Please fix this problem.,0
The app overall is decent but does need some improvements like for example sometimes I just unmute without clicking the unmute button and that really makes me have trust issues with this app. Please fix thanks,1
Thats good,2
"My one reason for giving it 2 stars because it has no option for raising hand and also it has no other stickers, so that I can easily respond to the teachers during the classes. Sometimes I face problem in doing online class in meet due to this reason, when I face a network issue I couldn't properly respond to the teacher. So, I request you to please see this issue.",0
Very poor quality and sound,0
"It was real choppy at first,but then it crashed and my phone restarted on it's own. When it returned and I rejoined the meeting, it cleared up",1
We can't even sign-in to our accounts. No matter how many times you try it says incorrect credentials.,0
It was great. Thanks.,0
It's a ossum video conference aap I luv to use this app,2
When I am.muted and switch to another app this app will disconnect my Bluetooth headset and switch to speaker. When I turn speaker off my headset is activated again but low quality audio and microphone doesn't work well. 100% failure rate. Zoom doesn't have this problem.,0
I use this for online class but Microsoft meet has more options than this that's why I gave 4 stars to this,2
The newer the updates get the worst the app is. There is a mobile glitch in assignments that you can't open a pdf file ( I don't know about any other files) I hope this app will improve updates.,0
Very nice! No problem at all with video or sound! Excellent app! 😁,2
"Once downloaded, which was less than two minutes, worked very well!!",2
This app is good for the online classes. But recently (this week ) I have a issue with the app whenever I tried joining a class it gave me a error code 104103. I hope my issue is solved the earliest.,1
Very usefull,2
Not bad but not good the video quality is bad and some time the sound glitches,1

"Too many technical issue. Not ""user-friendly"".",0
"The basic functionality that is the ability to schedule a conference call 
using the app is extremely buggy. There are major bugs in this whole 
application. Whenever you try to set up the conference says it is unable to 
do it, however it still sends out an email saying that the conference is 
scheduled, but when you log back into the app, there is no record of a 
conference in the actual dashboard so there's no way to modify it if the 
time changes without creating a completely new conference. Also when you 
try to add a participant directly to the fields in the app, it says cannot 
create the contact even though all the details of properly typed in. These 
are long-standing problems that need to be addressed, it's a real 
irritation with this app.",0

"You guys always ask for an update yet can't even fix your app. I can't even sign in into my account properly. It crushes every single time and redirects to signing page. It takes a number of times before I could finally log in then crushes again when I try to join a meeting. Like really? Zoom is even better than this. Get your app fix please. If only your app wasn't required by my company, I would gladly uninstalled this.",0

There was so much lag in the conversation and it was very hard to hear and understand what the doctor was saying because of that. And also so much background noise from the system!!!! The video part was very nice and clear so that was very helpful!!!,0
Couldn't hear the host of the meeting when using my phone. It was annoying and made me look like an idiot because I kept having to ask them to repeat what they said,1
Good app,1
Good,2
I am giving 3star only because there are a lot of problems here. My request is to fix the bugs and problems immediately and you should add the feature of virtual background for mobile users also and the problem or bugs which is here can't join a meeting.,1
Pretty good app but has basic audio features missing. When attending a meeting with Bluetooth buds such as pixel buds you can't get audio on them. Also audio is not streamed when casting the screen from pixel phone. Audio works properly with other apps but zoom does not support this like other meeting platforms do.,0
Audio stopped working. That defeats the purpose. It hasn't worked for several months.,0

"installed app for an interview. could not hear. ""hang up and i'll call you"". no need for the app if i can't hear the person on the other end and she had to call me to conduct the interview",0

Am giving this app three stars because everything is good but the problem comes in when your trying to sign in,1
Bad experience its because i cant change the background and also the video we had presented on this app was there's no sound. I wish this app could be upgraded early as posible because we have used this as our schooling tool. Thank you,0

It doesn't work sometimes. The connection is poor. The camera does not work. You can't see the other person or they can't see you even though the cameras are on. Other times the camera is off and you cannot get it on.,0
Excellent audio and video quality. The initial sign on was a bit cumbersome but once connected the app worked well.,2

Alerts for meeting reminders aren't customizable. When going from Bluetooth to speaker and back, call volume drops. Meetings in progress get hidden in the UI when screen locks. When unlocking screen, if meeting in progress wasn't on top, it gets buried. Mute & unmute not shown on lock screen. Delays in synching.",0

I have used uberconference for years and it has always performed exceptionally well. It is a great tool! Love the free recording and its tie to temi for transcripts. Amazingly good products and services for a great price!,2
The app is great but I wish that we could add stickers to the chat area when talking,2
Verry good,0
Zoom allows us to be present virtual in our church services...just a blessing in this time when you're unable to be present physically. My smart kept me in touch once there's wi_fi...wonderful form of interactions for all .,2

Unable to connect on the meeting for over 35 minutes. That's ridiculous! 95% of members experienced the same difficulty. We only have 2%of members on!!!,0
It doesn't work,1
Best app for corporate,2
Zoom should improve the functioning of this app.,0

Bryan and Janalee Ensley are disgusting people.,0
Better,2
"First time using my cellphone with this App. The experience was ok. * Audio was ok. * Video was ok. * Manuverability around the user interface was ok. I have an IT background so that does come into play, but I'm also pretty good at understanding the consumer's expectations regarding ease or difficulty in using consumer products or services. So a Three Star rating along with an 'ok' in customer satisfaction can be interpreted as a worthy market achievement as this conference did not demand more.",1
Can't find my workplace after putting in my email to sign up,0
Zoom meeting is now the way to go.,2
Using this app wasnt too hard. I have cataracts and couldnt read the sentences too good but as the teachers spoke it made it easier to hear and understand.,2
"Works seamlessly, great that they added video. Love that you have the option to not use a PIN.",2
Good working condition and just helping each other,0
My tablet spends a lot of time buffering when using this app. I haven't had this problem with other video conferencing apps.,2
In this app I can join every meeting but some problems are there,2
Okay,1
"Overall... I like the way of layout. First I cannot delete photo by photo, instead need to remove the whole folder. Second can't download file into iPad. please solve in next update.",1
"I cannot believe that a behemoth company like microsoft would allow such a complete trash fire of an application to exist in the state that it has always been in. Incredibly slow, sucks up so much memory, bogs down other programs, randomly kicks you out. Words cannot describe how much I hate this application, i wish i could give it less than 1 star.",0
The thing I love most in this app is the clarity and the way it facilitates the organizer,2
Excellent app,2
"Great service, no issues with getting dropped off of meetings and very easy to use!",2
An racism app,0
Zoom is a good app but nowadays I am having some problems joining the classes and not only me all my friends are also facing this problem . I am disappointed with this app .,0

Wonderful app. Love iit.,2
Ill be using it from now on.,2
I enjoy the app but in the meeting the app kick me back to the what's app and again I can't talk or open the microphone on this app,2
My experience is good and app also nice but one problem others can't hear me properly and I also can't hear properly others but the app nice.,1
Works pretty well most of the time,2
No Ads! But Audio Quality needs improvement. Definitely very user friendly,2
The meeting get disconnected again again causing huge loss in studies...... And my voice is also not audible to anyone in the meeting...... Please correct it ASAP... It's causing lot of problems and loss,0
No voice at all..very sad!!,0
"I hate this app. I've reset my password twice, and still can't get into my meeting. Last time I used it, the camera wouldn't turn on. Time before, I kept getting dropped from the meeting even though I had full WiFi signal. It's maddening.",0
Updated it 2 Das ack only when I try to join a meeting the are asking to update again and this circus is going in loop,0
A bit of lag. The screen might have been freezing due to internet connection. It is a really helpful app. I love the fact that I don't have to expose me and my son to the open environment in this difficult situation (Covid-19),1
When we call someone from teams app in phone and want to share the screen in laptop then call is put on hold. It should allow to share screen. Basically unable to talk and share at the same time. And again had to use the traditional way of dialling phone numbers to talk.,1
Nice,2
"Only basic functions, barley any customization possible. The competition is way better",0
"While not as easy to use as Zoom, the go-to-meeting app is functional. It would be more functional if there would be easier to swipe left or right on the mobile phone to see who is actually on and talking at a particular time.",1
Loveit,2
Good,2
Organiser had difficulties with the techcnical aspects and hence the presentations were delayed slightly.,1
Good,1
World's worst app i hate this app,0
First time using the app seemed okay I could hear and see everything okay I wasn't sure how to download or turn my mic on or anything. It might have not have been an option in the meeting. Not sure,2
How to manage on this app if I am working with two different organizations?,0
We will see,1
i like this app because its easy to use,2
"Good,but I have to install it much more times because after leaving a meeting the screen gets tucked. And it shows that you are in the same meeting and doesn't allow to join the next meeting.",1
When I am opening Go to meeting in my laptop Mozilla Firefox is opening despite downloading the app in my laptop,1

No problems are serious lots of amazing options. keeping in contact with friends all over. Maybe the one drawback is the occasional feedback ringing,2

"everytime someone is using ""share content"", my ms teams crashes and leaves the meeting and i can't go back, everytime i try to go back, it crashes and leaves the meeting, why is that?",0
"Problems joining calls, changing from handset to speaker to Bluetooth. Why is a call forced over cellular network instead of using data/audio already in the call?",0
"We need better control over notifications. Allowing ""important"" messages in a muted chat for example would be easy.",1
"Bluetooth headphones don't work with the App, only if I join/create the meeting through Chrome. Changing profile image doesn't work either.",0
The app takes time to load,1
"Excellent application, connectivity with audio and video quality is awesome, but it has some issues with internet data. This application consume 1GB data for 2 hours meeting and that's a lot of data for a meeting application. Developers should do something about this problem.",2
Works as advertised,2
It keeps crashing on the mobile version everytime I join a call for some reason.,1
Poor connection,1
Great clarity 👌👍,2

Feelshheavy and slow most of the times. Hangs sometimes specially after few minutes of continuous chat. Otherwise ok for async chat.,1

Super app,2
"Great for connecting with people and getting to see their face, which is more personal for business meetings, social events and even some churches are using it. This app came right on time!!",2

"I wish i could scroll to see participants not on my screen. I would also like for the person speaking to automatically show up on my page. All that said, I am using a smart phone which may be the cause of my concerns.",2
"It is very helpful; however, you should be able to mute the app without it affecting desktop settings. In order for me to mute the app until needed, I have to uninstall and re-install. That is inconvenient. Once I mute a setting on the app, it affects Teams in general. I just wish you could control the app more freely without having to always re-install/close/open app to mute when not needed.",2
There is a problem in app there are only pictures of features but there no feature in the app of change background and rays hand ✋✋ there are no any changes like the imeges I hope you see the problem,1

Excellent,2
This app is good but when I want to add another account and type the correct password it says try again. I tried doing it almost 10x but its the same. I can't add another because of this.,0

It was easy to set up App and execute. Only issue was delay between people and picture break up time to time.,2
App crashes all of the time and the sound/video stalls with regularity disrupting the flow of mertings/classes. Had to switch to another company's app and found the 'support' with GoToMeeting unhelpful.,0

Poor audio,1
Funny,0
Some times I can't hear anything while joining . Pls fix it,0
thik than satisfactory,1
Good app for students but some students use this for fun in classes.,1
Excelente,2
Dislike the green/yellow light of your status. Gives people the impression you're not working if your status is yellow. Should have some control on that timing.,1
Great for pratic of work and cheating but it has a noob think that We want to share screen for work then first we want to sineup only one time than we make many links,2
It is ok but it has a lot of technical issues,1
One of the worst application ever,0
Big size :-(,1
I have given this a 5 star earlier but now after learning that it's audio automatically disconnects on using certain apps I have rated it 4 star. So please look into the matter and update it.,2
VIDEO SETTING ARE TOO BAD CAN'T INCREASE PLAYBACK SPEED CAN'T ZOOM AND CAN'T ADJUST VIDEO QUALITY,1
It is a uniserval app used by us it was soon cool,1
So easy to use,2

Because it has so many glitches You might get 5 stars if you would make the problem solved.,1
"One week this app worked perfectly on my Samsung Chromebook and the next it would not even open. I need to use this app in Google Chrome for an important meeting. I downloaded it on my iPad, however, the app doesn't work well with Safari",0
It;s ok,1
Good app you done i need more apps,0
Waste of downloading this app because it lags and phone gets hang so don't download this app 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬,0
"so far so good, easy and well connected to the meeting. No interruptions, options to speak in audible and post questions, comments, etc. 👍👍👍",2
It is very nice and smooth app and uptade is also in low data I love this app,2
Very nice aap,2
it's nice to use in our online class but please repair the bugs like when someone is presenting a powerpoint its backing on its own when you are in mobile.,1
I like it but I don't love it. Sometimes it is hard to find a past conversation to follow up on it later. When you are communicating with multiple people it can be hard to find the right link to respond back later.,2
Best,2

Pls remove that option host can on or off the camera or m8c pls or i will no attend the school and delete Google meet😠😠😠,0
"Please fix the notification. I almost missed my exam, if not for my boy chatted me.",0
"Too much updates, when I restarted my phone, it keeps kicking me out. Whenever time I join my class and it kicked me out, fix this. I don't wanna be in trouble.",0
"The app is fine, but as soon as i open my keyboard, the input text field is covered... Impossible to see what I'm typing.",0
why there is a time limit,1
It always says 'incorrect password' even when I typed the correct password. Dumb app.,0
Everything goes mute. Cannot use earphones to listen in,0
"The zoom app is working very well, easy to use, and accessible when last minute schedule changes are needed.",2
"This application is not working properly on Browser, many times i faced problems during session strating, somes times 3-4 sessions is not connected, I loss that sessions 🙃🙃🙃🙃",0
"Wouldn't let me on for the first several attempts. Got on and it worked fine for about 20 seconds, then it put me on sound only mode with no clean way to get it back to the previous screen. It is an absolute disgrace to any person who loves freedom to be muted or cut out of their own coart case during any coart time.",0
This browser is very much helpful and easier to handle and demands comparatively less strong internet. So I think this will make a very familiar and interactive meeting for the users.,0
"I need this app twice a week. Often while on the train. I face many problems and design flaws. Chronologically: 1. App sends me a notification that a session will start. I click it but it only gives an error message. I have to fire up the app myself. 2. Session starts and by default the sound goes to the speaker. Everybody around me can hear it. I need to go into a menu to change that the sound goes to the earpiece. Why do I need to search and click three buttons for such a simple and necessary operation? 3. I hold the phone to my ear and now my cheek starts pushing random buttons. Why doesn't it use the proximity sensor and turn off the screen like proper calling apps? 4. So I locked my phone manually, but now it's my turn to talk. I unlock my phone and everyone waits for me. I need to find the unmute button, but it is now hidden behind the menu that I needed to fold out for the other audio setting! I couldn't think of a design worse than this if I tried. 5. Of course when talking I need to lock the screen again to avoid pushing random buttons, unlock it to find the mute button back, lock it, and unlock to leave the meeting. 6. I tried using the phone call but nobody hears me",0

It's a good app but I can't get the background changing feature even after I updated it....... I even updated my device thinking if it needs new version of the device.. but it doesn't come... only this thing makes me rate this app by 3 stars,1
Having major difficulty changing zoom accounts..... If you work with two facilities that use zoom...this will be next to impossible to sign in.,0
Outstanding performance with voice and video.Best for video conference.,2
Voice not clear. It's too low,1

Hey why is my meet icon not moving when going to another tab 🤯 correct it right now i am frustrated my class in not going like that,0
The MS Teams mobile app is better than before with large gallery and together mode also in place. Having said that there are other improvements required to improve the app as well.One key requirement is to be able to search and filter Teams that we are managing.I manage a large number of Teams in a school and it's very difficult to locate a specific team that we need to go into.,2
Netrabc,1
I use this app for weekly therapy I highly recommend it for video conference meetings. A five star rating would be received if there were some sort of tutorial to show off all the features and give the users an idea of what we can and cant do.,2
Excellent 👌,2
Make dark mode,1
Audio is poor quality with frequent disruption of speech from the speaker.,1
"Frustrating, unreliable, app doesn't match Outlook calendar details often, refuses to actually start a meeting. This should be all easy, but it just isn't. Tip to WebEx.. Just work like Zoom or you won't be around much longer.",0
I am not able to open a single PDF or file in ms teams it loads for 1 sec but don't open ..... + Not able to upload any file from my device to this app.,0
Great way to communicate when not everyone can physically attend a meeting or presentation.,2
Always lagging and causing problems for other people in our group meetings. It really kind of messed up the whole experience of being in a rehab group.,0
"lag on call , very poor quality today",1
I would give Webex 5 stars for this except that the polling function for Webex Event does not work correctly for Android phones. App only allows first poll to be displayed and taken and poll closed and results posted. Any subsequent poll opened by poll coordinator does not display for Android phone users. Note: Polling function works fine for Webex Meetings.,1

Audio control and functionality is sketchy on mobile App.,1
It is a nice app it is helpful for all the students which can not go school 🏫🏫 studying online .......but I just have one complaint that is that if any of the student is taking classes in mobile so his or her can not put a background ......and if they get any duty then they can not fullfill it because by the school 🏫🏫 they are forced to put a background. .........so I just want teams to improve it,1
"The platform is good. The development efforts are much appreciated. Unlimited meeting time and decent number of participants , is a relief.",2
Awesome for my new job! Fantastic love it,2

Please solve this problem as soon as possible.",1

"It's very easy to use, basically a 123 type of system!! Never have had any issues or complications before or during a meeting..",2
Highly recommend for team calls and individual sales calls.,2
If they made better adjustments to whiteboard the app would be a 5/5. Collaboration the way it is now is very minimal and difficult to manage,2
"extremely poor performance, search is non-functional, and half the menus don't load. trying to browse any given chat is a nightmare! the lack of threading and separation of chats and teams is a major drawback from something like slack, and the calling features feel like they were pulled from lync 2007. I'd be ashamed to have put out something this shabby.",0
"It's a VERY GOOD app for online meetings but recently I have face this issue where when I was in a meeting it keeps on getting disconnected or sometimes my call dropped. Also, there is this problem where I can't see the screen eventhough my wifi is stable or the audio is lagging. Can you fix this issue ??? I can't always give the same reason over and over to my teacher if they keep asking me to answer their question but I keep on saying ""my wifi is unstable"" 💀",1

I have given three stars because when i use google meet it always show a notification that we couldnt process your call,1
Great but they are getting rid of the free option. Scrambling to find an alternative.,0
Thank you for adding hand raising for hosts and co-hosts. This facilitates zoom classroom style discussions. I have one additional request. Can you empower co-hosts to have the ability to pin key speakers for all viewers in a Breakout room to see the same thing the co-host does? Again in classroom style learning formats pinning is also important in breakout rooms to give more focus on the information in the meeting/class,2
I don't know how people work without it! What do you do to discover each other's work?,2

I have to give it one star cause the new update is bad. Everytime I open an app the zoom lags and then my laptop crashed cause it can't handle the lag. Remove the opening app lag. (Zoom suck),0
I open the app and it just says no internet connection or trouble finding network. All my other internet apps are working so it's the app. Not internet. Even when I use my data it doesn't work. Have tried uninstalling and re installing but didn't work. Very frustrating.,0

Teams as a work application is not that great but the handheld version works great. It's 10/10 for me. Pls try to improve the desktop version reduce the animations and improve the appearance and fluidity. Make it require less RAM and processing power. Zoom is relatively more practical. It's desktop version works great for me and not much of the RAM is covered and it doesn't require much background power.,2
Difficult to hear people.,1

Bhai nice apo,2
It has been very useful in keeping in touch with family and friends. A great source that has been beneficial for uplifting me for I'm able to chat with people whereever they are. I am enjoying this app very much. It's a wonderful app.,2
Teams is convenient and helpful in many ways. I wish it were easier to manage sharing a screen and still keeping the video present across monitors. I used three monitors and teams behaves erratically sometimes in that the controls move as I share and unshare and sometimes it's difficult to use and manipulate controls and windows while I'm also trying to present. I wish you were possible to anchor it in a particular place where I could reliably alt tab back and forth to it.,1
Disgusting App,0

Worst app ever!!! I can't see any presented content most of the times even when my internet is fast. The app closes on its own when I switch apps and automatically leaves the meeting. All Microsoft apps have a huge size and are useless. Google is much better though. It provides good services and requires comparatively less storage.,0
Very user friendly,2

Used to be able use this app regularly and it was good but lately the volume seems to be non existent and I can't even hear that meeting that I logged into.,0
Audio kept dropping and members got disconnected. Also I don't like the idea that someone else can mute my microphone which was done multiple times. I wasn't even talking when it happened. There is no background noise here where I am so I don't see the reason for it.,1

"Awful, one of the worst apps I've ever used. Losing connection with the cloud server even when the connection is solid, reliable, quick with no packet loss. Doesn't store user name so after loss of cloud connection this has to be re-entered, this is extremely tedious. I'm baffled that this has been released, it's not even a beta trial just crud",0
This is very amazing app i like it so much i can do class and talk with others also but one problem is there sometime it is teachnical issue 🙂🙁,1
Can't listen to anything. I find google meet far better than this.,0
"the older version is much easier to use, sure there a lot of new features available in the new version but the older ones (when the logo is still the simple green meet logo) is much easier to navigate and use, ( could chat while still looking at the video, could scroll through the partcipants videos and pin them , its just much more convinient) please fix it 👍",0

"I am grateful that Zoom has given us the opportunity to hold meetings online. I have attended many webinars & learnt a lot. My worry however is that at the slightest network glitch, it goes off but most painful of all is that all the chats are lost. I would appreciate if it's possible to have the chats retained (intact) no matter how many times one has to re-join due to data network fluctuations. Thanks.",1
Good app for work purpose. Easy to chat. When 2 people in a call we can't record the session. One drawback in this app. Video call is good. Should have a good internet supply.,1
Very good,2
"It consumes a lot of Internet data and Picture quality is also not that satisfying according to the data it consumes. Try to rectify this problem. As a suggestion, give option to choose the video quality (just like YouTube has) so we can save the Internet data.",0

"Weird. There are 2 issue I'd request to get fixed in order to earn 3 more stars from me. First, chats usually don't appear on the home screen after a video call. Second, The call quality is sometimes too poor on a totally stable internet connection. Looks like Teams isn't able to use full bandwidth of my router.",0
"It was very smooth,but sometimes the voice can be very low and not clear.",1
Great way to have a state-owned meeting during this pandemic. I hope we continue to utilize this to cut travel costs in the future.,2
Superb,2
I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL DISASSEMBLE AND REMOVE THE RESOURCE FILE YOUR APP USES TO RING. GIVE US THE OPTION TO SILENCE (THAT MEANS TURN OFF COMPLETELY) NOTIFICATIONS. THAT MEANS YOU NEED TO STOP USING YOUT OWN HANDLER FOR INBOUND CALLS AND USE THE NATIVE NOTIFICATION METHOD LIKE EVERY SINGLE OTHER APP THAT WANTS TO HAVE CUSTOMERS. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON AT ALL THAT ZOOM SHOULD NOT HAVE THIS FEATURE. FIX IT. TODAY. ADD A VARIABLR FOR VOLUME. USE IT IN THE EVENT ARGS AS THE PARAMETER FOR VOL.,0
The app is not working and keep telling me un update is needed and when I go to App store there is no update icon.,0
19 aug. The record option is missing... It was a great help in online classes. We could record the class and sleep at the mean time...

"Use the number only portion and the screen sharing-document section. Need to explain the difference in accessing. There seems to be a difference in set up. I can access the app on my mobile, laptop or desktop or remote in one of our conference rooms, but there seem to be very subtle differences. If you are a gotomeeting veteran, you can figure it out via trial-and-error, but of you are a neophyte---you can easily go into panic mode because you did not understand the subtle difference.",2

It runs on its own after downloading . But I went to see if there was a way to test sound etc.. also while looking up other things I wanted to know if there was video and audio settings. The help page said in the upper right hand corner and listed settings available. I am running a Note 20. These settings don't show on the screen like it claims. If I am missing something I would like to know where the menu is for the settings in call or not in call. Please don't ask me to submit a ticket.,1

THIS APP HAS SO MANY BUGS AFTER UPDATE.AND SOME NONESENSE THINGS ARE GOING IN THE MEETING.BUT IN THE MEETING IT IS BEST APP EVER IVE SEEN THIS IS WHY I GIVE 3 STARS 🌟🌟🌟,1
"Great application, however, very, very taxing on battery life.",1
"Volume wasn't very loud even though I had it all the way up. Other than that, everything was great",2
Saved gas,1
In this app the singup problem,0
"Dear Sir/Ma'am, I can't connect to the zoom meeting. It is showing error and keeps closing. It is happening from 2-3 days. Before that it was working properly. By the way, I don't know it is happening only with me or my other classmates. I am a student and I have to study through this zoom meeting app. So, I request you to fix the problem so that I can use it without any problems.",0
Voice not clear,0
Good app.,1
"Please fix your bugs, I've turned on all the notification, but still, the notification won't come out",1
Works pretty good but video turns off sometimes,1
Very good for me but the meet consume very much data,2
Nice that the app allows fingerprint authentication. But it always says my password has expired yet I'm using the same password for the last 6 months. When I manually enter the password it works. Stupid,0
Mostly good quality video. The video chat is trash. Cannot see all members when talking. Cannot school through to video boxes of members. The chat window is too far in the GUI. Some changes really need to be made.,0
The app and every thing is good but it takes to much of my internet and it stucks even with 30 Mbps,0
Very useful app. Easy to use.,2
Gud,2
Thanks,1
This app is good. but nowdays I am unable to attend a meeting in this app. it shows network problem; I don't know why because my network is good. I am giving it 2 star. I hope you will fix the bug in 2 or 3 days. Please fix this bug 🙏... I am unable to study online..😐😐😐😐😐😐,0
The app is really good. It certainly helped me to continue my classes in online during pandemic.,2
Trying to get business,2

Unable to see other than one other participant at a time. No settings option on my green video icon other than stop screen sharing. Need the option to view other participants. Seems to work on apple products but not android.,1

Intresting,0
"Sometimes the audio and video glitch out. Typically, however, as long as you (and the others in the meeting) have a good internet connection all is well.",2
"Every day during online school I always use gmeet. But whenever someone else shares the screen, it doesn't show up for me. I have joined several times and still not showing up. Already *reported the problem* but still. How could that be? Please fix.",1
A great app for school and easy to use perfect for homeschooling etc 😀,2
Good,1
Gui not usable,0
Could not get the audio to play through my headphones. Only through the phone speaker. Not ideal.,1
"This app was nice....but when i try to join any meeting it says connecting for 5-10 minutes and says couldn't connect the meeting and contact customer service and I am not able to find any filters in my video even if I download them plz try to improve all this , Thanks",0
Increbile option during these trying times. Audio was very poor on my end but seemingly well on receivers end.,2
"Often good although I lose sound sometimes, which may or may not be my Network connection.",2
My zoom still has no feature of the virtual background. Really need it though. Hope it can be fixed.,1
Good,1
This app is very good app is used to anothere mobile data,2
"Definitely needs improvement, Audio connection stops frequently and needs to be reset so you miss large chunks when someone is speaking. Makes interactive meetings difficult at best.",0
"The app works mostly pretty well, but using Bluetooth is wildely inconsistent. Sometimes it will show that you'll be connected with Bluetooth and then once you join it wont use it. When it works corectly you can use BT, your phone, or speaker, but whe it doesn't you have to hold it up to your ear. This is obviously a problem when im traveling and someone is presenting or im in the car. Well documented problem for a couple years on the internet that MS should have fixed by now.",0
great service!,2
"App asks me to enter my workplace email to check if my company is enrolled. I enter that. On the next screen, it shows me my work email address, but the field is locked. I don't use my work email to login. I use my personal email, but because the field is locked, I cannot change it, and hence keep getting a wrong password error. Please fix this. Probably, just need to make the email address field on the second screen editable. I can see a lot of people at my company running into this issue.",1
Unable to hear via audio option. I was able to see presentors . Video worked fine,0
Good app but gets disconnected from mobile version,1
"The app has been alot benefiting to I and friends. It's convenient and better, with a stable network.",2
"The zoom app is good but sometimes the sound is cut off and the video is also not visible properly, Sometimes the whole screen turns black. plz UPDATE this, Thank u🙏",1
"Works fine so far, no issue found. Stable.",2
It's good.,1
",༎ຶ‿༎ຶ",0
This app is good. Doesn't cause hot performance ram to my device but sometimes slower in stream conference.,1
Ice,2
Too slow,0
"Good at using in PC because it don't need to install launcher like Zoom Cloud Meeting, but it's hard to change name directly, you need to go to Google Settings to change name then you can using Meet normally. And 1 thing need to improve is increase people to join meeting because only 250 people can join the meeting. And it's hard to see anyone who don't turn on camera in classes. So I rate this 3☆.",1
good,2
Please just let zoom use Snapchats camera Because I can't edit myself on a phone,1
Nice no interruptions,2

So far so good. Enable dark mode for compatible devices,0
"The meeting had technical difficulties throughout starting with the log on you could not get the audio and video to work together after that appeared to be OK, the volume kept decreasing to where you could barely hear",0
i do not see any advantage when you can not connect with others so easy,0
Still you have to add more functions and user-friendly interface,1
"Very bad interface. In full screen, slide is 20% cut by notch.",0
The network is very bad,0

Trying to join my meeting via the app on my note 10+ 5G was horrible. Login screen kept changing my user name to my personal gmail email account after entered my work email account. When I got my info in, it was rejected and I couldn't get to my room. I hope this can be fixed. Not everyone has a seperate work and personal phone.",1

Ok,1
Good,2
Best for meeting,2
Nice app,2
We want Estes,0
Ok 👌👌👌👌👌👌,2
Almost OK. Someone left and Someone joined notifications at the bottom of the app are hiding screen shared by the host. Keep it simple by removing background (white) colour of that notifications text or move it somewhere else. The total number of participants goes hidden under that notifications.,1
"Please get the app to stop running in background. recent update is now causing force close issues, even with formally closing out of meetings.",0
Life changing,2
"The app can't transfer sound via Bluetooth, it just doesn't swich the channel. When somebody phone you, it goes muted, but doesn't unmute back! Finding how to turn on the sound became a problem...",1

It's easy to use and it does the job. I've used the screen share a million times and it's super useful.,2
Was different.,1
"This app is currently not fit for purpose. THE iOS app is brilliant, but this version feels left behind. Not updated since 2017 - it's barely worth keeping this on the store. All it does for me is open the appear.in web page.",0
I think it only work properly if fast connection is there and not is average internet connection.. Technical team should do something regarding this issue..,0
Facebook needs to have a way to help people whos accounts have been deleted I am being forced by my job to use this app and I do NOT WANT to use a product from facebook. LIFE has better has been with ut facebook but the sudden shock and loss of so many photos as I had an account a LONG time and It is sad so sad that I ever trusted Facebook with anything and NO BUSINESS SHOULD!!! My ads I paid for were also a lie. Unrealistic numbers complete garbage service. Facebook should apologize!,0
Using this app for my company communication very nice,2
I like GoToMeeting conference app much better than all the others! Ease of use and great features. Thank you!,2
Frequent loss of connection,1
Party Roy,2
So difficult to use.,0
If I can give you a (zero) star I would love to. I have been receiving invalid activation codes from you. It's almost 1 week since my company sent me my workplace log in details but I haven't successfully opened it yet because all the activation codes that was sent to me is invalid. I think you don't want me to use your app. It's so sad because I really need to work immediately but your app disappoints me .,0
This app is awesome! I started using it on my desktop and use it on my phone now. Haven't had a problem with it at all. Beats Skype by far!,2
Here up.to a certain point. Bandwidth low. Could not use video. Some of the virtual presentations could not be seen. Thank you.,0
"Superb.Pls do white board , only host can present,disconnected audio",2

upata,0
"I have been using this app for about 2 years and I had a good experience. I'm a student so all my online classes were held on this platform and the assignments,calendar etc,they really helped. The reason why I gave this a four star rating is because whenever there is an update in the app it says ""Hang on,we're getting things ready for you"" and that is SO time consuming and it never really works... I have to delete and reinstall this app again to finally fix the problem.. Hope this is fixed soon.",2
Not loud and clear voice. Very complicated to login.,1
Not to much handy,0
"You can not do any better ZOOM! With the ads though I do not get any on ZOOM for what I do. Thank you you for asking me to rate ZOOM. Sincerely, Patricia.",2
Not nice,1
calling system is just like 5 star but one zoom app named team games gets hanged so I cannot play it,2
Real-time audio and visual effects are clear. Split screen presentation from moderator-to-moderator seamless. Little buffering here and there.,2
So efficently good audio,2
"It's a good social network, but is missing one thing... dark mode! Pls, developers ✌🏻",2
After updated the new verion it is not supported to connect my oneplus blutooth hedset,2
"The app doesn't work at all. Reading the reviews leads me to believe that Five Star Ratings have been awarded by people high on crack. (Seriously, there a recipe for a club sandwich in the reviews!?) After attempting multiple times to connect with my team, we realized that nobody else was having issues because they were all using the desktop version.",0
"Teams app is super easy to use! Especially if you have work but can't be at home you can still get on your meetings, etc on the go. No complaints here. Works every time with no issues.",2
Due to Quarantine we are trying to have classes but we can't connect the video. It keeps buffering I dint expect this...😑,0
The update makes it more confusing. When a meeting going on and turn on full screen It's showing the owner's icon largely and prevent you to see full screen presentation. What is this? Meet's devs are really thinking it is usefull to see icons of myself when a full screen presentation going on! Please fix this issue. People nowadays depends on online class and meetings. That's why your competitors are getting popular when I think it should be reverse when meet released.,0
"Im on a chrome book and cant use the drawing tools, they do not show up. How do I sort this out?",1
"Great functionality, but..... I think Microsoft has fallen victim to their own success here, I use teams all the time between my day job and other adventures. The issue comes when you try to switch between different teams on different accounts, The app frequently locks up, or shuts down when trying to switch from one team on one account to a different team on a different account. Once this is streamlined and doesn't cost me between 30 seconds and 5 minutes to make the switch this will be a 5 ⭐",0
A good app with clean and smooth video quality. The only problem is it consumes too much of internet. It is a problem for mobile internet users.,1
Very good tool to connect and get updated with company's activities.,2
Good,1
"It's a little rocky getting started for the first time but then once you're on, great quality, easy to use and navigate. Really enjoyed the app and plan to use this app many more times .",2

Microsoft stays ruining things. You'd think for a tech company they'd get one thing right. Another failure. Still can't delete threads and for my line of work this is an extremely dangerous thing. Cant even get a month to month calendar view. Now we're not going to be able to use this on our cell phones in my organization. Fire the developers. Now i hear you're adding a praise app..for..what. fix the base app first,0
"Its really bad now....updated it , it glitches and it always feels like it breaking connection.... I dont like it when we trying to do other things the screen goes black...instead of shrinking into a smaller screen. Not recommending",0

I'm having issues with teams and not getting the support from Teams,0
"They keep taking away functionality... ugh! And the latest version I have on my phone can't stay connected despite my being 10 feet from access-point (on a gigabit, both-directions, network). So frustrating to clearly see every way that this app is broken. Their desktop app is getting worse at the same time. What the heck! If you cannot put out a good product, just don't put out ANYTHING. And then to take away functionality while breaking what is left behind. Ridiculous.",0
"nice app, similer app like what's app also would be helpful for individual projects groups and should be secured through work mail ids",1
Nice app,2
This is worst app because i am doing my math class itvwas just disconnected not for network issue because of time limit and the class has got ended,0
This update will take 140 MB .Try to keep less data consuming for update.,0
Really as the app receives updates it becomes more buggy,0
no recording option seen for attendees,0
After a month of working fine the app completely stopped me from opening any and all files. This has happened across multiple devices and is very unreliable. I have been trying to fix it forever but haven't found a fix. Apparently it has happened to many people and it was never fixed. I highly recommend not using this app on android devices. It will just fail you sooner or later.,0
Complicated didn't like,0

"I am rating it from my experience on my mobile device. It's difficult to find the kind virtual meetings I am looking for. I can figure out how to navigate my way online, whether it's a website or an app, but not on Zoom. I couldn't figure out how to add my photo. I didn't try too hard but I didn't want to spend too much time trying either. Also, is there a way to bookmark which meetings you like on the App? Is there a way to look for a meeting on the actual Zoom app itself?",1

Very bad experience,0
"《Update: upped to 2 stars because of dev reply.The misleading generated link by GoToMeeting for scheduled events takes you to a mobile page where the only visible link is to install the app or open the meeting in the app. Does not give the user the option to join online. The user has to navigate to the appropriate page to join on the site, using the meeting code, which renders the short URLs useless.》 Used to be able to join a meeting from website.

"Need to streamline and simplify joining meeting and hot swapping from mobile to pc or vice versa especially to auto-mute if an audio feedback loop is created accidentally.

So worst app cannot log in through Google. It is showing wrong password while joining meeting.,0

No clarity in voice,1
I can't use Ctrl+c and Ctrl+v on the laptop version in some pages. The reply button needed to be scroll up. Would expect this kind of user experience from rising new app but not an MS product with such a big brand name. Funnier thing is you need a MS account to complain about it on its forum. Would,0

This a very difficult program for my old laptop to run. I end up using my tablet in tandem but you can still only see 6 faces and this is hit and miss as to if you have the person speaking on screen. Other platforms appear simpler and less taxing on the equipment.,1

It would also be cool to have a feature where we can adjust a another person's volume, because there are times when a couple of people are too loud. Please add it, because I'm almost certain a lot of people would find this feature very helpful for whatever reason.",1

I love the it makes school a lot easier. I have been using this app for 2 years now and I can't stop using it .

"There seems to be a bug when using bluetooth earphones. The audio is heard fine through the bt headset, but Meet defaults to using the device's built in mic and not the mic on the bt headset. Yes, I made sure that Bluetooth is selected as the audio source via the icon in the upper right corner. Regular phone calls and other voice communication apps on my phone work as expected with the same bt headset. The iOS version of Meet doesn't have this bug.",1

Would have given 5 stars but the worst thing is that if we pick up a call ...the meeting gets disconnected which is really problematic.....cause sometimes we need to take an important call in the expense of attendance of the class,2
"Terrible software. I am constantly having to login even though the ""keep me signed in"" option is selected. This happens on all devices (Android, ipad, chromebook).

"Have used this app with only workable issues for at least a year. However recently I encountered a more serious issue.  Seemingly suddenly during conference calls my mute button began failing. Initially I thought my phone had failed but I continued to have the issue after purchasing a new phone. After doing some troubleshooting I was able to confirm that this app caused the problem. I have since uninstalled the app (a problem because I have multiple conferences a day) and resumed using my mute button on my old phone with zero issues. I need this corrected ASAP that I can resume using the APP with my calls. This is a serious problem and major issues and I believe it began with the update that was completed on Oct 13, 2017.  Update 12/1/17 I reinstalled the app on  my Honor 6 phone with no issues but on a galaxy note 8 I still have the problem.",0

Marrying visual with audio on the same device is extremely helpful and minimizes disconnect between what you see and what you hear.,2

Teams is good. The problem is there are no stickers like in whatsapp. Maybe it would be better if there were sticker packs like in viber without creating our own. It would be good if their were creative things added to the private and chats in general. Adding more options to the youtube section cz i doesnt work well searching videos arent working well. Their must be a age restricted mode. There must be an option to delete the chats like in whatsapp. To make a auto generate the bad words into***,1

Audio cuts out intermittently.,1
Teams helps me keep up with what's going on even when not in the office or at my computer...fairly easy to use and navigate...just remember to default the camera to OFF 😁,2
We want estes,0
Works flawlessly! Over Wi-Fi and 4G as well.,2

"Sometimes hang and sluggish, no volume control up or down option in the app neither the phone options works on speaker, login second time or refreshing make the app hang again for a while. On laptop same issues except the volume with too much lagging.",1
Good,2
Very difficult to connect with audio. Was there an app change? I never experienced that before,1
Uses way too much power for what it is intended for and heats up every device to the point of overheating within 15 minutes. UI freezes constantly and joining a meeting takes longer than similar apps I've used.,0
Really enjoy being able to quickly ask my co-workers a question. Keeps are phones from ringing all the time with questions.,2
More fix,0
Improve your video quality and remove sounds of mic button(when press) .,1
Nice app. But I am facing one problem my mic is not working in any meeting. Please solve my problem as soon as possible cause I am using the app every day.,1
Yes every one is writting correct. I have a lot of problems during my online classes . I always hang out from the class and sometimes I also suddenly came out of the class(with out touching anything). When my camera is on everyone says it's off.,1
"I used to love appear.in for its ease of use, and started using the Android app to make it even easier. However, recently I have faced too many technical issues for me to continue using it. I found that when starting a conference the application would lock up my UI thread and prevent me from doing anything with my tablet.  Totally unacceptable. Resolve the technical issues and I will give the service another shot.",0
Nice but good,1

"It worked, but the audio was spotty. On other conferencing apps you could make the view so that you saw the other person full screen. I'm new at this and so maybe I could figure out how to make it full-screen, but today my son and I were in a tiled view, meaning that each one of us had half the screen. it was hard for me to extend my arm long enough with my cell phone to show my entire face! The jury is still out!",1
Not very convenient,0

Why do to the point of the fact that I have been doing the zoom an know that I have had 3 yrs of being hacked from an iPhone that I never wanted especially after they listen to everything and when you zoom nobody should be interrupting them the fraud this spam calls done but the zoom now I can't figure out,0

"I love Teams as an app, however the way it couples with work-life balance is completely unacceptable. In Outlook, I have my working hours set up and it's made very clear to people when they try to contact me outside that time. This does not carry over to Teams. Hence my husband and I were both woken up by a random phone call at 5AM. If you have the app installed on your phone, as long as your phone is turned on, you are 'available'. This is ridiculous unless you have a work phone. Things that would make me reinstall: - The ability to automatically set myself to Do Not Disturb outside my working hours - A status message automatically popping up (like in Outlook) when I am outside my working hours - Being able to make the phone app's status only count if the app is actively open",0
Causing echo problem (other people hearing their own voice) and also my voice is too low to others. I have given the permission for microphone. I'm using Samsung Tab A7.All other video call meeting apps are working fine.,0
This app is using much data according to other all app so i request this app to use less data nd all should have virtual background in zoom,0
I appreciate the option to switch to another device when in a meeting. It helps for those situations where you have to step off on the desktop and have to switch on your mobile. A huge help from the hassle of joining on both from the phone and desktop then disconnecting,2

I am giving 2 stars to your app but just have a look to my problems and try to resolve them .,0

"Super Awesome. I love one of the recent additions of auto connecting to Bluetooth after the app is open and then Bluetooth is turned on. Seriously, quality app programming... Older... This app just keeps getting better and better. I truly am amazed.",2
Cons- user Chat window doesn't scroll up well while typing a message. I have to hit back to remove the keyboard from the display and then scroll to the bottom. Pros - Transition between mobile and laptop while on a call is seamless. Like this element very much. Apart from that it's a full functionality collaboration platform with support for all major apps including the competition.,2

I am not happy with the fact that it doesn't allow more than 10 people at a time to get on. I'm always getting complaints from people receiving an error message that says conference call is full when there is less than 10 people on. Other than that the quality isn't too bad!,1

Used for running therapy groups and staff trainings. Wish it allowed for videos but the audio doesn't work for that. Also it drains the battery very quickly on phones. The chat option gets saved to everyone's computer which is a HIPAA issue.,1
Slow as hell,1
Guess works ok. Went to do my first conference and the audio was completely muted not sure why it would download like that.. the biggest problem I have is that downloading it changed a lot of my settings that of course I had to give permission to do but didn't expect it to change so many settings that then caused me a lot of issues for instant changing photos i took after from jpg to another format then when I went to send jpeg photos they were not in a source to open few other things too,0

Works well so far. The web version seems like it might be more friendly as the app version doesn't seem to give an option for which number to dial for contacts with multiple numbers.  Hopefully I won't get a message after using it twice about how they have to charge...like the other app I tried.,2

Every time I get on webex for a class or meeting I have trouble With the mute button I can hear the instructors but they cannot hear me I press the mute button over and over and over again And I cannot Unmute It takes me a bit a good 15 to 30 minutes For me to be able to unmute I get very frustrated with it not responding as it should,1
"This app is bad. It's difficult to navigate and it's over complicated. Nothing about it is intuitive or seemless. I'm using it for ""hyflex"" classes for college because of Covid. I'm not bad with tech or apps normally, but nothing about this is a pleasant experience. Even though it can get ""hacked"" Zoom was easy and smooth. I can't imagine how hard this will be for my 60+ professor to use, if he could hardly figure out Zoom.",0

"It's an okayish alternative to the likes of Zoom, but it could definitely use some additional polish!!

Also, the connection doesn't seem quite as stable as other similar apps.",0

"The control buttons are easy to operate and understand. The video and sound are very good. It was easy to join a group.

Quite often out of sync with desktop application. Especially with unread markers which annoys me quite a lot as I start to read stuff and realize I go through a second time. As a general optimization: I'd like to have a notification booster for specific channels which are close to sms ring tones.

This is a really excellent app for students (as I am a student too) but reason I gave 4stars as if we have to submit assignment we have to click images from the teams app or use some other app to make PDf there must be a option to make pdf in the app because the teachers always forces to make pdf. So i hope you will add this update soon,2

"Platform lacked cohesive user interface so I could, for example, easily recognize my ""video"" must not be ""stopped"" so I may be seen active in the meeting, or that my microphone not be muted but unmuted and to do so I must find my microphone in lower left corner of ""the box where my video appears"" and select the microphone to remove the red \ and unmute.

As a student I had a horrific experience. The app is never comfortable with the network I could not hear the audio and the app unmute itself whenever it wants. Which Led to ruin my name in our universityas there were background sounds of construction . Most of the time I was not able to judge whether the meeting was active or not this was my worst experience with all the app till now I don't recommend this app Worst app ever,0

Its cool but the share screen isnt working,1
It's nice,1
This app really seems to need more optimization for the Galaxy Fold. It can't decide if it wants to be in full screen or side bar-window pane mode. Just constant glitches and it's 50/ each time I open the app if I'll be able to do anything in it. Shame because I rely on Teams for work and generally like it.,0
Last patch hangs most of the times.,0
Absolutely brilliant experience.. Went without a glitch... Would recommend it 👍,2
it is great but every week this apk just deleted its self,1
Reliable and good,2
I like that it offers so many options but I think the video quality I not so good but if we increase the quality the data consumption is so much. I think the problem is that the app is made as a general video conferencing app but if they focus only on students needs then the app can be better. I am also not a fan of colours it uses they are very dull colours and the user interface can be improved but I should say functionality is amazing.,1

Provides essential functions with clean interface and always works flawlessly. Only negative is the awful hold music.,2
App is good But i can't connect the audio to the Bluetooth head set.,2

How to varchual background in zoom meeting,0

I think that the zoom whatsapp and Gmail are better because zoom for meetings Gmail to post like assignment WhatsApp to chat and I think this because you get so many glitches everyday. I am a student in a school and if your not able to open assignments you will get Zero marks so I think teams is 1 of the worst apps. I think that Windows hase so many apps that they don't focus on some app at all. Just give a update then after 2 years they give the next update i personally think that teams is one,0

It also seems to do a good job with noise suppression so that background noise doesn't completely interrupt the speaker.

There were times that I can understand why I suddenly dropped from a meeting (I left the app and kept it open for too long while my phone settings specifically closes standby apps running in the background), but more often than not, I just disconnect with no discernible cause. I have looked for solutions before, yet nothing lasted.",0
It is perfect,2

My button to leave a meeting gets hidden behind the 'person x left the meeting' notification. Audio sometimes starts in speaker mode while I have a bluetooth headset connected. When I switch Audio device or when I get a phone call and reject it, audio volume gets halved and very low quality, restarting the app is the only fix.",1

Theres a pop up that says start video. Very user friendly!",2

Still the worst app. I told you many time this is the worst app now by looking at rattlings anybudy can see it. Less than 4 rattling is a bad rattling but this deserves 2 star rating in playstore,0
I've been very happy with using this both for remote martial arts classes and professional meetings. The connection had been good and sound is never a problem. Easy to use and overall a great experience.,2
I can’t really use the virtual background. I think it is not compatible with my phone because you need to meet the requirements. I hope you could fix it. It is unfair while others can use it while the us are not.,1

"It is a good app for a limit, but you should fix that videos take a little bit of time to load even on fast internet, moreover, you should fix the full screen in videos (only the borders color changee from black to white when i allow full screen). There should be a video rotation button. Inaddition, when i pause the video, the start and stop bar still steady and doesn't get away so i can't see anything on the screen. Also, you need to add a button to forward and backtime by 5 or 10 seconds.",0

"Please consider for a moment how frustrating it might be to log on to a meeting 5 mins early and be told you have to log on again later because the host hasn't started the meeting yet. It seems like it should be a basic feature for pple to come a little early and be able to wait without going through the log in process again, then again if the host hasn't done whatever the host needs to do to start the mtg, then again if the host is late. Why does webex put mtg attendees through this annoyance!!",0

It seems each time we use the app we get a little better at navigating in and around it .. which shows progress.,2
This,1
very nice :),2

The only reason I Give it 4 stars instead of 5 is there is not clear enough instructions how to connect other people to your meetings,2
Very effective with my coaching clients.,2
"Very bad connections with the meeting. Cannot enter the meeting in time. Always shows loading icon and connecting icon when a meeting is entering but cannot enter the meeting. After sometime its shows that there is no proper internet connection to us even there is stable internet connection. At last , have to improve the app very much. Thank you.",1
"It is a good app , but there is a bug that while meeting automatically many of the attendees are getting removed from meeting, i.e "" SOMEONE REMOVED YOU FROM MEETING"" please clear that bug or glitch .",1

"Not sure why this app exists. Like others have said, it would make sense if this would allow you to be part of your conference call as it you were signing in through your computer.

The WebX platform is OK but sometimes the writing on the screen covers what is being presented by the facilitator making it imposible to read. There also seems to be problems with the connection or software that may be causing the audio to cut in and out.,1

You've conducted one survey of user feedback in a long time and it only asks the questions that can't collect the flaws. Q 1: Was GoToMeeting easy to use today? Q 2: What do you like about GoToMeeting? Let me tell you what I DON'T like about GoToMeeting. I DON'T like the frequent cutting of voice. Why do you only ask what I like; why not what i don't. I also DON'T like the inability to mute someone if that person is being annoying.,0

"No stability issues for me, has a few visual bugs in the interface (e.g.: showing meetings as ongoing when they ended or the other way around). I have a powerful phone and some colleagues complain about stability and re-logins, I suspect that Teams background service is being killed by the OS as resources are needed. One thing that nags me most, and this happens in the desktop version (Linux/Mac version) as well, is the impossibility of scheduling (and checking upcoming) meetings through it.",1

"Amazing quality! I have been using this app for Video Court (so MEGA-important stuff!!) and have had ZERO problems with is. The only issues I have witnessed were with Internet Audio (possible problems on other users end) and they were able to immediately rectify it by using the back-up system of directly calling into the prescribed meeting.

MS Teams has been of a great help lately but some features seem to be just placed as a showcase. The Data Saver feature is not literally preventing the data expenditure . As a school student I've my online classes from Teams and at the end of the day I see my data used up near 1 GB despite of turning the Data Saver on. And though it eats up my data but also the camera quality reduces drastically. I would request you to kindly make amends in the feature soon .,0

Really wanted this to work.  But it doesn't for me. When trying to add people to the room I can't see or hear them. Have given up trying and am uninstalling. Shame.,0
Generally pretty good but it's super buggy. I have an incoming call notification stuck on my screen constantly. Only way to dismiss it is to reboot my phone. Also sometimes only my pc rings and not my phone or vice versa and sometimes when im on a call on my pc i still get another call on my phone (seems to desync). If they can fix this it would be much better!,1

Waste app. Calendar is not even loading. Zoom is better than this. The assignment file is not even loading. I recommend not to install this. Teams is degrading instead of updating.,0
Poor connection. Video display is not clear.audio poor,0
Overall I had a good experience. The only thing I did not like was there was no option to privately send someone a message!! That really needs to be fixed! UPDATE: They added the feature so you can privately message just one person not the whole group! So I changed the rating to 5 stars,2
Working,2

Relatively new user of the app. Haven't explored it much. Overall experience was good and the app features used were basic. I especially liked its auto dial feature to meetings without any interaction. The chat and related text and emoji formatting should be improved.,1

It need more upgrade there is audio problem and video problem i think the app has to work on his interface and add some useful things.,0
Not sure yet I'm new to this app but I heard it was good,1
This has assisted greatly with my work meetings throughout this pandemic. The features for the backgrounds was an added plus.,2

"Audio was fine, but the video was laggy and occasionally cut out. ( maybe the fact that i was using my smartphone for this conference call had sonething to do with that?)",1
Shifts features is not working properly. Every time new shifts are added I have to reinstall the app to check the updated shifts. Kindly fix this.,1
"Bad experience every time I have to uninstall the app due to buffering and hang on,",1
It worked well.,2
So you are telling me that I cannot watch youtube or run any other app in the front while attending classes on this app. Because everytime I do the audio gets disconnected in the span of 3 minutes. You guys fix that and take my 5 stars because there's nothing more I expect from a video conferencing app. And yeah this issue happens in the pocket mode aswell which is literally made to run the app in background.,0
Makes all the processes low fps and laggy,0
Nice,2
Very good,0
The features are great! The calls are clear. Extremely easy to use.,2
Fix it pls..:(,0
"I saw others communicating to the presenter, but it seemed unavailable to me on this tablet. It was difficult to control the volume on tablet speaker or headset. Headset volume control seemed to be blocked...way too loud!",1

Only webex not working with Bluetooth speaker by using webex Bluetooth service (not particular, all other Bluetooth speakers also).

Better,1
Very useful 👍,2
Nice one,2
Sometimes the audio is uncontrollable. The video is not in sync with audio.,0
Should try to make atleast the size of pin video on duoble double tapping to full screen mode it will help everyone to who are doing explaining something in the meeting. The one more difficulty is that wr can't we pin two or three other people who not as important as host but important than rest of the members. That may be a semi-Important pin. Thank you I hope this proposal willbe accepted.,1
The problem is after teacher gave us the invitation link though LINE. Nobody has join the same Meet that our teacher using. It's like we're in different room even though our teacher said he use the same link that he gave us.,1
I like that the limit of people who can join is large but just make the transitions more seamless,2

"I was forced to use this app on my computer for work, instead of Skype, for some reason. On the computer it works OK, but after downloading and giving up Tons of info on my android I discover that it doesn't work at all without having the device make a telephone call, which my device does not do. Skype can make this call over wifi. Additionally, it doesn't even show chats, it seems. So, completely useless app for me. Also doesn't seem to save a list of conferences that you typically call so you have to keep typing in the URL.",0
"I don't use Zoom on Android often, but as much as I do, it seems pretty crash-prone, especially when interracting with the chat during a meeting (for example, when trying to copy a message).",1
"Cant log in, cant send invites cant do nothing ? Da fup haha",0

"Please provide: Mute all & Unmute all button. Atleast to the organizer it can be provided. My daughters school uses Google Meet as a tool for taking classes/lectures. But kids are kids, they are unstable. Even though teacher says to keep quiet and remain muted still some students Unmute their mic and cause disturbance. I have observed myself that sometimes the teacher gets frustrated So request to have Teachers' login and students login. Teacher can mute whole class with just one button click",2

Sound is low despite increasing to highest settings. Can not have camera and sound at same time. Have had to log out & log in again just to enable audio meeting solely. I found this frustrating!! And if the other participant didn't have their mouth close to the speaker it was difficult to pick up on what they were saying. A frustrating experience for me.,1

It is a amazing app but this month there is a problem entering the zoom even my network is good and respond error networks.I miss my class so I want to fix this issue. I hope it will be fix soon.,0
Feeling safe to use for my company's socmed purpose. Details are here in the Workplace but still secured nicely. Good platform!,2
Facing multiple technical issues on win10,1
Meeting-support went very well. It had good clarity of video and audio without extraneous interference. Thanks for the good service.,2
It's a vry good app for online classes and meetings but the prblm I faced is it is covering much of the phone's storage.,1
No screen share,0
The full screen Mode in phone is very poor for the new Update. Because when you potrait the phone My ID photo is displayed in the middle righ side of the Screen where I can't see some contents during presentation.☹️☹️ Please check this and fix it please because for mean phone you have to potrait the phone to see well the presentation 😔 insted I become annoyed only.,0
Reasonable intuitive but because I could not be verified by gmail I could not speak and say something critical. All I could do was eave and not wave and some on said not waving drowning and they were right. If you know the rules of the sea then just to stick your hand up indicates distress.,2
It was very refreshing and useful especially tbe part regarding EQ and IQ and what is really Important is to continue without bringing Ego while participating,2

"It won't refresh new chat, kinda annoying",1
"This worked out of the box to connect to a Lifesize video conference. However, the app did not recognise my headset, and only sent audio received to my loudspeaker. (I use a USB Type-C dongle to headphone port adapter as my phone doesn't have a 3.5mm headphone port).",1
Need to stop streaming buffering facility in zoom and use technology like playit software or MX player,0
Nice app,2
I don't like it much because of its slow slow speed,1
Not allowing to add multiple accounts,0

"Can't participate, left meeting and closed the app but audio continued to play from host. Glad I could uninstall the nightmare of an app.",0
Great,2
Since latest update it keeps crashing. Barely works at all.,0
"I've been unable to open a room.  Looking in the comments, I see someone else reported this issue weeks ago.  I hope someone will notice and resolve this issue.",0
I don't know why but recently the assignments in teams are not opening idk it is a bug or glitch.,0
Very very very bad App I am giving 1 star because in Teams if any P.D.F. is in assimengts it does not open it shows a technical issue...,0
Nice☺,2
Good,2
I love the options,2
In Corona time it's the best app for students n teachers.. we can attend online classes here without any interpretation,2
When I tried to login to the app from my samsung tablet SMT230 it said bad network n cannot login. Then when i connected the tablet to mobile data n again tried to connect to the app it still didn't work. Also when I finally logged into the app from my smart phone I still had issues with network and had lots of video n audio loss inbetween the meeting. Thus I overall experience was not satisfactory.,1
This app is quite good but there is still some sound problem and if this app can fit 100+ people I might give it four stars but no but still it's a little bit better than other online meeting apps,0
Functinal and a decent UI,1
Just ok,1
The call gets cut if we use another app also sometimes audio disconnected doesnt get connect even after my net is good ....pls add a feature of hearing the video sound from another app along with call audio,0
Continously voice crack and audio disconnect,0

I asked one question more When we are teaching thorax and lungs then why not we start yoga classes in continuation.,1
"It's simple and works well, but I wish there was a way to have the chat by the edge of the screen besides the screenshared video so that the video won't be covered up when I want to access the chat popup window. Kinda like how it's laid out in the desktop version. I'm on a tablet and have enough screen real estate for it XD",2
After the last update I can't download files from the students assignments to my phone anymore. The same issue is with my teaching colleagues and on my android tablet... We have to go through Google Drive now in order to download simple jpg./pdf. files... A waste of time.,0
Sometimes it doesn't connect,1
Yery unreliable. Chat logs often change minutes after. I often get notifications of a chat. Then I look at the app. But the chat is not in the app. It was only a notification. It often takes some time for the app to catch up. I have also seen Time Stamps change while I am using it. Getting a notification that is not reflected in the app is almost unusable. I use this app at work. It is a large waste of time and cause of frustration.,0
"Every thing it good on teams on pc but I am always connected to teams on my pc and on my phone, sometimes I get message on my phone and sometimes I don't, I don't know why, if there is any settings, I always want to receive chat/call notification on my phone.but I am not getting always but only sometimes.",1
"Ok when it works. For a while it would randomly stop updating and I would have to uninstall and reinstall to have it work again. This time however, it now won't let me log back into it. It just freezes when it says its setting it up and won't continue from there. Tried deleting all the info and cache but still doesn't work. I need it for work so quite the bummer.",0
I have a suggestion regarding Muting the host by participants. There should be an option which doesn't allow other participants to Mute the host or other participants. Fix it please.,1
"Initially, ran into trouble as the purple bar with a # on it was not pressable, and the green checkmark on the keypad did not submit the room code. A call to support (and a bad review here) brought quick response, which is appreciated. After three months of multi-point use: this is a solid high-quality software. Good audio quality, and is given priority. Quick focus switching when someone starts speaking. Facilities for all the usual videoconferencing features. Kudos to developers.",2

It was difficult to set up the first meeting. Could not do it from my desktop computer even though I had installed the application and I had the correct identifying number for the meeting. Still have not solved that problem. And the video windows on the phone are way tiny compared to what you find on other comparable apps such as Google duo WhatsApp and Zoom. I only tried this app to to talk to my wife who is in the ICU and the hospital is only setup to use this or FaceTime and I won't use Apple,0

I didn't like this app. This is easy but privacy is very bad. Sometimes zoom isn't respond our problems. I think Telegram best than Zoom. Sometimes app dosen't working well. With some errors.,0

Poor video quality. The lag between participants talking makes it difficult to have a conversation. Regardless of internet speed the system tends to lag.,0
It's a amazing app we get alot of help from teams and we can also chat but some times my mobile gets hang and no class links open,1
Zoom is the best way to online mitting so please are goodnes of things,1
"The mobile version is unreliable. The video sharing option frequently doesn't work and I have to restart my phone to get it to work. When I click the vido share button, the icon spins indefinitely. I also noticed that the audio is choppy since my Android device was updated. The desktop version is more reliable.",0
Totally awesome!🔝🔛,2
I absolutely love this app. It is great to communicate through business and keep all of the drama from the world out. But I do have an issue as many others in my organization do with being unable to scroll through other people's profiles as well as their own.

Overall the app has improved a lot by its quality of video and net issues. But it still has a lot to improve.I like how the background option was put but the raise your hands option is still missing and there must be options when we can mute all of the class during a webinar and the host can unmute when the person is asking to by maybe a button and there can be option when removing a participant there must be a choice to remove and lot them come back again.a delete option in chatbox will be good,1

Network issues,1
"When I open the app, all I get is a blank screen with my Teams icon and a search bar. Messages and people pop up when I search for them, but I can only get to them by searching for them. Other than that it appears as though the app works: messages I send and conversations I start are shown in the desktop version in real time. I am using Teams for a corporate account using the Intune Company Portal, for context.",0

It's not perfect. I find the drop down sharing menus are not consistent depending on whether it's a meeting or call and the audio microphone options over Citrix inconsistent too. Also difficult to manage text chains (can't delete) and invites for recurring meetings don't work when inviting some clients,0
"I have a paid version. I need to unsubscribe now. Cannot at all find where to unsubscribe. I've sought technical support for other previous issues. No one got in touch with me.

The company I work for has a limit to how many days we can be automatically signed in on microsoft applications on personal devices. Everytime I reach that limit i have to uninstall and then reinstall the app. This is due to it glitching and sending 6 or so 2 factor auth notifications. If this gets fixed I would be fine with the app,0

Many students are using it via cellphones,this app need to improve its performance in cellphones too.",0
"I'd like to request Ms teams to put background in cellphone other than laptop's and apple's. Since some of the teachers or professors request us to put some background.

"This is the first time I've used cisco webex and the sound was wonky. In other words, it was very low. The visual controls were counterintuitive. By that I mean if something has a slash through it, it usually meansva negative or no. However, with this app it means positive or yes. I've been using Zoom for grad school at CUNY and with passwaords it is fine. Your platforn needs a lot of work to reach ZOOM's standards.",0

I love this app really good and so much useful now i can listen my class properly😎🤙🏾. but the reason why i give 3 stars is everyone in my meeting is changing backgrounds and keeping effects but i alone can not change my background or keep effects😭👎🏾they told update your google meet but it is already on update but my effects and background is not coming for me alone😭👎🏾.,1
When I host the meeting. Screen freezes. Also when people have it on their phone they cant see others the way zoom does it.,1

Cisco webex is a good app but unstable. It doesn't always work as intended. sometimes the link doesnt work for people outside of organization. You cant record the sessions even you have been made presenter or on panel for someone elses meeting. i think they nee to chnage the permissions for recording.,1

I like this app for the most part. It has been pretty stable for me and I feel like I can depend on it but there is one thing I would like to see. I would like there to be a way to get notifications when someone messages me directly that doesn't involve a notification every time someone messages in one of our group chats. As far as I can tell this is an all or nothing setting.,1
Experience not good,1
"Keeping the mic always on and ""muting"" it within the application is not only unsecure, unrelieable, but it causes wireless headsets to drain faster and makes the overall conversation barely hearable if you have feedback from mic to headset while the mic is enabled. It makes any environment unusable even if you are just a listetener.",0

I could not find the calendar shown on the desktop version, demo appears to be an iPhone. I am an Android user so where is my calendar",2

Back when we used to have online clases here in greece i was like this app can be laggy sometimes also you can take online classes and metings on this app it maybe laggy sometimes but im fine with it also i counts on the better or bad device you have thats why it laggy so i give this app 5 STARS because it is a reallu great app,2

Can u take the timer off of google meet its annoying because we have to wait a hour or something and then it says 10 minutes before the call ends can u do something about it please.,0
For my last few sessions I had a very hard time hearing members in my group meetings. I don't think is fair to have the sound interrupted all of a sudden just because you get an un- expectect phone call😨 It's also very uncomfortable to shout so they can hear every word I'm saying. Can someone look into that?,0

"I use this for work. It's a very useful tool. You can interchange between the phone and computer app seamlessly. We use it for individual and group messaging, calls (video and voice), meetings and file transfers. It's all integrated with the MS Office software, so no glitches, yet. In these strange times, we would be lost without Teams. Addition: like a lot of MS Apps, Teams is greedy for space, it takes up over a Gb of space even with careful policing of it.",2

I shouldn't get notified on my phone when I'm actively working on PC.

This app helps me to attend my meetings but sometimes it stucks so. I can give only 3 stars .,1
Few missing things/ Issues- 1) Data usage during video call is very high. 2) No option to set background on this mobile app. 3) There should be default settings to see the organizer pin or auto focus. 4) Problem if multiple people are speaking on the same time. 5) Taking and uploading picture does not have option to create pdf file directly. There are so many other missing required features and issues.,1
Poor audio. Generally annoying. Teams is much better,1
Always reliable,2
Good meet fir classes,1
Sucks,0
I liked it because it's easy to use this app than zoom because it asks some details where as google meet doesn't ask and is safe for children easy to control no hangs or stucking screens and no ads it's totally ad free so I am rating this app a 5 stars .,2

"I used to have trouble with the app and it's performance. I dreaded the idea of attending calls when I was away without a PC. Things have changed very much for the better. The meeting layout is well thought out with a navigation feel similair to that of the desktop experience,. It's nice to just click JOIN in a calendar invite and let Webex Meetings reliably take care of the rest.",2
"Even tho my phone will be connected to by Samsung Earbuds, and every other app will utilize the Bluetooth sound output, WebEx independently chooses to not recognize that there is Bluetooth sound output available and will just output calls using my phones normal speakers. This happens on almost 50% of my calls. I have a Samsung S21 so it's not even like my phone is old. The app just bugs out",1
The computer app is buggy. sometimes the phone app doesn't sync with my computer seamlessly. I would like more control over certain functions like out of office messages via the phone app instead of the need to login in via PC.,1
Excellent,2
Call volume is fairly low so it's a bit hard to hear people sometimes. And it appears that audio is delayed by a whole second or two so it's easy to interrupt out of context.,1
A simple and easy to use app for meetings however audio keeps cutting in and out and I haven't been able to find a satisfactory solution. Video seems to work fine though. And it's not because of bandwidth because other apps work just fine.,1
"I have been using this app happily for many months. Now, I can't logout of one account to login to another (I have 3 full office 365 accounts and 1 free teams account). I can no longer open any type of document in teams. My status is showing as unknown and when I try to change it to online or reset status, it says there was an error. I have Uninstalled and reinstalled which did not help.",0

So, I went through a few peoples' reviews... and wanted to clear up a few things, First, When you turn your data saver ON, and your voice/video quality is poor, it's bcoz of the strength or the connectivity, it'll strain more if the connection is poor and use more net. Second, if you're facing any other problem/glitch/lags, ... just let it be, it's a maintenance prob, and will be solved soon. All I wanted to say! Thanks :) (*and no I'm not an MS employee/representative)",2
need to improve more and more as of now looks fine,1
Great.,2
Relatively easy. First meeting using app was successful. No technical issues. Sound and video quality were good.,2
This is not the app I wished for in online classes. Whenever I join from phone after a week or 2 the app says the app is not responding. I need to download the app again while my classes are going on. My lot of content is missed and I am unable to do anything about it. But one thing I like about this app is the easy switching over to another account on phone. Sometimes after download the app still doesn't respond. Although the new reactions are very cute and I love them,1
Update w/o version notes.,0
Is not possible to simply disable notifications. The only solution is to uninstall the app.,0
For the past week the app is not loading. I've had this app for 2 yrs now and was working great till now.. what happened.,0
Nice,1
Has been useful when I can't be at the computer as long as I don't need to use video. Last time I used this app and needed to use video and now my display intermittently greens out. Wasn't going for destroying my phone just to use the app on the go.,0
Good app,0

"The only problem I have is when I have appointments with my doctor and want to schedule or setup my next appointment, it sends me to my calendar and has me make it on my Google calendar. But it doesn't show up in the app. So the option to use this it's pointless. I can mark my appointment on the calendar myself. I figured I could setup appointments and I would be prompt to the meeting room with my doctor.",1
Cant get audio to unmute when wanting to talk with meeting,2
Too much things not easy to absorbed.,0
Not bad,0
Web version works great but the mobile version is really really bad. Can't seem to connect to our speaker & mic properly.,0
Just another surveillance application,0
"I haven't used the app very much so, I can't really offer too much about it.",1
87mb of trash,0
"Used for a product demo. Absolutely no issues at all, and I DL'ed it 5 minutes before the meeting.",2
Use this for work. And like it more every day. This continues to be a very good app... Continue to use this constantly.,2
"trying to install this app on my computer, but it will not let me. It notices my other devices, but not this one. Any suggestions?",1
Very good and convenient except for small connection issues,2

It would have been nice to not only be able to use it for one specific work use purpose type app you need to make it so other people can use it like say if my wife is in the fields of nursing well if she has to call her boss she needs a video chat while she's at the patient's house she can't use this or if I am at my job and I'm trying to show a client something and he's across the country or in another state I can't show him a live video chat of what's going on the handyman type work so yeah yo,0

It is hard to sync files from Teams to a directory. When opening excel file in SharePoint it is not that easy to update data. Can there be a comment field how to do these when you hover them. In Teams what does upload or download do? Would you be to I increase intuitiveness of use. Thanks,1
Person giving talk kept fazing in and out but basically not bad,1

Not a comparison just my review I felt it's just better than zoom but video quality is just not so satisfied I hope you will understand my problem ☺,2
"Microsoft Teams has certainly improved and has fixed many bugs over time. There are still many annoying bugs - which should be fixed. 1. A simple copy/paste from MS Word or Excel messes up the formatting. This doesn't happen with Slack, or Google Chat. 2. Compose a post in ""draft"" mode which has people tagged. Click on another post while the first post is still in draft mode. Return to the draft. The formatting and the tags are all messed up. 3. Edit of a post messes up the tagged people.",1
Good sound quality,1
"I am still not able to view the ""change background"" option on my android phone. When it is going to roll over, it is an important feature for meetings.",2

"I would like to address a small issue which is without logging in to change into another new email address for forgot password. I forgot my password for my Teams account and my old email account. So I hope to get another alternative way to send a reset password into my new email. But the problem is, it only allows me to send reset password into my old email but no option to choose to send to another new email. The Github option is useless to me as it is, but no offense though. I tried.",1

"The chat is horribly buggy. The concept of a combined ""seen it"" just doesn't exist for Microsoft. They maintain I haven't read messages (on my phone) in a thread I've already replied in (on my desktop). So Everytime I open up teams I see lots of seen, useless notifications that I can only clear by individually clicking through each chat and pretending to read them. Oh man, how did you get the basics of a chat app so wrong?",0
Good for lockdown,2
It's still buggies and if you are not the host you can't do anything would be cool if you could give admin access to anyone else on the meet almost like host just to give a bit more control in a meet,0

"Would be great if emails from Teams didn't go to junk, you would think my Outlook email would intergrate more seamlessly. Also the calendar view is pretty poor as it doesn't label all day events very well, having to click on them to view details. The calendar view would be better if it was more like the outlook app calendar so I could see events in month view. Finally an option to view team calendars within my outlook calendar would significantly improve the experience.",1
No good,0
App is very best but one setting is not better the setting is personal massage as like zoom app when we sent massage to our friend the massage seen by teacher and teacher get angry because this reason Change this setting plz,2

"1. App keeps crashing on Android, even after reinstalling.   2. The platform does not offer any task/project management related features as other work-related apps (eg: Trello, slack) do.  3. Does not offer calendar integration, file sharing/collaboration, meeting/webinar integration etc. Some sort of integration with other platforms, such as, google calendar, GDoc, Dropbox, GoToMeeting, WebEx would have been useful features that could potentially set Workplace apart.  4. Having the option to open discussion Groups including users from other organisations seem an useful feature helping cross-organisational collaboration. Similarly, ability to publish or cross-post from inside Workplace to other external platforms (for some chosen items) would have been a useful feature, saving hours of staff and team-coordination time. Eg, publishing an Event as a public post or to an FB page directly (via integration), twitting in the same manner. This way 'under-the-hood' team/task management inside Workplace could instantly translate into actions outside the platform, without having to spend/invest (distractingly, if I may add) too much staff-time in those external platforms.  As a 'paid' service Workplace should consider implementing some of these work-related features, paying close attention to work related needs. As a starting point, please open a 'feature request' tab/link somewhere, to be overseen by an attentive/engaging CS team, even if they engage with SysAdmins only.  Thanks.",0

"So I use this app over others because of the SSO enterprise system at work. The most annoying thing about it are the notifications. Using both the app on desktop and phone means that I receive notifications on my phone for chats that actively having on my desktop.

During early days everything was fine but since last two days my meeting is automatically getting minimized and showing ads almost 10 to 15 times in a 40 mins meeting which is creating a lot of distraction. Please if it is a bug I request developers to fix it. Thank you",0

When I started using this app it was quite good. And it doesn't caused any issues during meet. But from last few days I'm unable to open other applications on background . If I do any of the minimise or back option . Screen goes black automatically and it suffered me a lot during the meet . I'm using Google meet n my phone . Please suggest something regarding this .,2

Great real time connection must make sure that you are connected to Wi-Fi if your data or you are not in the area where you can pick up 5G other than that they have to works perfectly for meetings etc.,2
"Inconsistent experience. When someone calls or messages it doesn't always notify me on my Samsung Galaxy S10. Also, when I open the app it says notifications aren't working correctly because background activity is restricted and to click here for settings. There's nothing in the settings that's off or restrictive. What does that message even mean? Why is it so inconsistent with notifying me of a call or message?",0

"It is the default app for all vatual court proceedings in Kenya where as a company representative I use it everyday for numerous court cases.

You wanted an email address OK need to login, but you also wanted my phone number!

Are there only chosen mobile devices where we can change background on the app not on the google chrome? There is no change background feature on my app. I hope that changing background is applicable to any mobile devices so that it will be easy for students to use the app rather than using the chrome to attend a class in Google Meet's website.,1

The thing I really like is how it lets everyone join and share ideas. Another good feature is the recording of your meetings and you may save them for others.,2
"App disables media sounds (like, you can switch a different app and zoom will be in the background, but THE F******* VIDEO YOU WANT TO WATCH IS MUTED. And so is zoom then. Very buggy in this scenario, and you can't tell me that's a feature, because it's not. If it had been one, you could turn this off.)",2
"These app is good ,but the mic problem is a issue , and very poor video colity ,And very the app is hanging my device , In my new device I installed the app then My phone is hanging and very hot ,and the apps storage is an another issue, Please Google fix it",2

"It's a workable platform. Sometimes very confusing for the presenter on how to share screens or if their screen is still showing to the audience. There are certainly plenty of options out there if you have a choice on webinar platforms and it mostly comes down to which options you want. WebEx could be better, easier to use, but it works well enough for most situations.",1
zoom 👽,1
Why as a host we can't see all the participants on the screen while screen sharing. Being a tecaher we need this function.,1
Add freaking adjust sound for 1 person cuz some ppl mics are Soo freaking loud [Pin someone and you will see the option to adjust their sound or unheard that person like discord (doesn't require to be host)],1
Why you all had maded this tyle of app the school uses it for classes,0

"It's a really great app, kind of like a shortcut to the traditional meet that you'd have to open in Chrome. Anyways I'd really want to give this app 5 stars, but there's one problem that I would really love to see in mobile versions, I would really want for you guys to add a background choice for mobile, since I've only seen it work on a pc. Anyhow that's all, I really appreciate this app.🙂",2

The worst app i have ever viewed because the sound quality is very low and when i use it on pc the sound is not at all clear and even in mobile it gets disturbed a no. of times and it was best when i used it for first time but then 2nd time onwards it became worst,1
"Tried this out to host a reading group that can't meet in person. I have used WebEx before and know how it works. However, it seemed as though despite muting and unmuting, trying to call in vs. internet, nobody except me could hear anything.

Updated application are too bad sometimes exit in meetings,0
"I do like it for my class,but the reason I gave 3 stars is bcause..there is no filters & change background on android,if you added these things in android,I will probably put 5 star,thankyou😊♡",1

Anytime someone outside my organization joins a teams meeting the call service is complete horror. I don't get it. I'd rather use Microsoft then google or zoom, but google and zoom at least provide high quality meeting both internal/external to my organization. Please guys... Get it right!!! I don't want to move my entire team over to Google...",0

"I was invited to a meeting 5 minutes before start time. I was able to install the app from the Google play store and get logged in on time with ease. The only issues I encountered were not being able to share my screen or upload a file. The host was not able to find the options so we used email. This slowed down the process. Honestly, I'm not sure if the issues were due too inadequacies in the app or in the host's setup. Overall, my experience was great.",2
"A good app for buisness meetings, and other things. The bad thing is: it keeps freezing. You get called on and you cant do anything. Chat takes a while to load, sometimes the shared presentation will freeze for 2 minutes making you miss important infomation. Sometimes while in a meeting, Teams crashes for no reason. (Longest Review that I've done)",0

Everything is amazing fabulous speakers and everything is okay.this new update about layout is also good. But reason about giving 4 star is that camera quality is getting poor I even once thought about lighting in my house that's why it's not getting my face clear but I got to know about it when I started joining from my laptop then I got to know that on laptop the camera quality is good and on my tab it's bad.,2

This app is too good but the problem was that it was taking too much data being a student my classes was from 8:00 to 1:40 it takes all my net 1.50 gb this mobile was used by my mother also but what benefit my all net was over so please requesting you to low the net taking please,1
After my one update the background option is not available 😞,0
One of the most confusing apps you will probably use daily if you download it but you still don't know the structure of the interface after weeks of use.,0
Niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeseess,2
First time. Just 2 participants. Easy to use.,2
I can't change my profile picture And it's soo irritating 😩😩,1
Good,2
I can't change my background 😭,0
Its really good but can be more easier so that kids can study easily (no opppse),2
Cuttings in between maybe it was connection problem. But otherwise when in order every word was clear.,1
Sooooo long and still no multi video feed (more than 4 windows) for Android tablet version. Super unfair that iPad has this function and Zoom refuses to develop it for Android tablets!,0
Good,1
File shared are hard to understand and manage.,1
"Vivo phones not connecting well ,and video is not coming",0
First time with Webex but all good so far. Would like to have known more about the controls before hand.,2
Wonderful app,2
Wonderful,2
"Hey, After the recent update, there is no option to sign out of the app. Can you please fix this",1
"Great app for us, how i wish there is a dark mode or night mode for this app.",2
"Workplace is not working in Bluestack windows 7 64 bit, help to fix the issue",2
Eye opening.,1
Difficult with checking to see if audio and video are working before a meeting.,1
"Put an option that participants can also use a virtual backgroud on phone, its so wierd that only the zoom creator can change its backgroud 😂😂",0
Problemas con la actualización de los chat,0
Average to medium poor video sharing and the sound goes in an out. ....In response to appreciated input. It doesn't seem to matter what wifi connection we are on business commercial account or high volume personal.,0
Very bad....,0
Would like to be able to block incoming phone calls while in a zoom meeting or at least make them not take over the audio because there's such a delay switching back to the meeting audio even if you ignore the call!!,2
Sat on phone for a long while!!,1
"After 4 minutes of call my phone was so hot it automatically turned off, no permanent damage.",0
"Excellent app for video conference, or just for online meeting... Reliable, easy to use and user friendly",2
"It was okay until the update happened. It getting worser and worser. Its not even my laptop problem.its really annoying when i want to have a discussion for any projects even with good internet connection, for some reason suddenly got kicked out from the meeting or sometimes it said 'bad connection problem'. Like my Internet clearly is in its strong status but i got kicked from the meeting like 4 to 5 times in a day.",0
Sound echo issue in my realme tab. Only meet having this sound echo problem .other app like zoom are working fine.,1
"I can dial in to a multi-way hi-def business meeting from anywhere, on my phone. Way better than the other video spps and services I've used in yhe past on my phone/tablet.",2

Nice,1
Little difficult to navigate first time users. Feel things like skype much more user friendly. Im not a fan of having to allow it to record me audio in order to allow me to talk with others.,1
Perfect video call experience . . .,2
Mast I love app,2
Not the best of virtual meeting apps,1
The call was going in and out and also my screen kept going black during the meeting,1
Missing features that are available when using the browser.,0
Nice,2
It was a great app. But since the last update I am not able to open the files/pdfs sent or submitted. There are alot of glitches since last update.,0

Stupid app. Crashed many times. Unpleasant color theme.,0

"Picture quality is good, audio quality is good",2
"It has been my nicest experience to know this plateform after sometimes inquiring about an app helping to call the whole world all together. For their conveniences, users should opt for it.",2
"Meetings never seem to work properly, audio never works. Waste of time, missed so much uni learning because they insist on using this poor service.",0
😎😎😎👌👌,2
I like it.,2
Not as clear as zoom. But heard it's more secure.,1
Why I join my class help for this app then I left automatic l no left myself l left automatic and I have so much network problem,0
App works fine except for incoming calls using Microsoft Phone System. The microphone volume is way too low for anyone to hear. This affects all our Samsung Galaxy phones of varies model types. Been through Microsoft support which was obismal they kept asking for the same information / logs etc which I gave everytime. Gave up in the end as they just seem to be putting me off for an obvious issue / failing.,0
voice problem strucking taking lots of time to join too bad,0
I think it's better,2
Best experience ever,2
"First of all this is good app I'm listening my class without any interruptions.... But its sucking my internet,,, when i attend class for 30minutes its use about 800 mb then how I'll attend all of my 6 classez...???",0
"Often distorts audio of both parties, video freezes and glitches in the middle of meetings. Not great compared to Zoom but slightly better than Skype.",0
It's good but sometimes because of Wi-Fi connection l am out of meeting again and again,1
I'm giving a start because I don't see the controls of the meeting like for example unmute/mute mic and turn off/onn the video on my android phone.,0
"On vacation. Had to listen on cell ph. Was outside, could barely hear @ full volume. Could hear fine when l had u call me.",2
Very good,1
Why does this app drinking my data like a drunkard drinking alcohol. I just used it for 3 hours without using my mic and camera even it used 1gb of my data. There is only one camera and mic on through out the time. It's very difficult for students to attend all the classes like this. I hope u look into this issue...,0
so heplful and stress free for is teachers who would qant to avail files from our group,2
Not good app,0
Ok,2
بدنیست,0
Slow speed ..... loading... loading,0
When we unmute or mute our mic we hear sound it annoys all the people in meeting hope if we can turn off that sound,1
Good,2
Couldn't sign in on the web version nor download the pc program. So I had to download the mobile app. But my class materials aren't available on mobile for some reasons.,1
Very useful.,2
Very user friendly.,2
Too bad,0
App is good but network connection error,1
Really zoom is an very interesting app I used zoom app from 1 year but in recent days it doesnt works properly it shows connecting and at lasts it shows cant connect to our server error code network connection but my data is good for all other apps but zoom shows network issue ..so i wish zoom will let help soon to this issue..plz i missed all my online classes plz solve this problem..,0
"Teams Meeting or Zoom is easier to use (options to raise hand, chat, add filter and background change).",0
A bit laggy. But the audio is okay. Its clear,1
This app works very well with the application on my laptop for work. It transitions back and forth from mobile to desktop application when getting or joining a meeting from laptop after transitioning from mobile (nice touch).,2
Good,2
"Poor audio connection even if you change mobile devices, or change it on app settings.",0
"There are some Bugg , assignment folder not open by Android phone",2
This app is Nice App Beautyfull app ....,2
"Over all Zoom has been exceptional. I'm hardly a tech guru, 'geek,' and don't really have the time or motivation to begin now. With that said, for going on the two years, of using Zoom, it seems a functional application with good professionalism. Thank you for all the invitations to learn more about Zoom and its capabilities. Keep up your hard work too stay competitive and, keep improving too move forward in the video conferencing technology.",2
I think this app is very nice compare to another app but my small request if it's have subtitle it will be great,2
"The app was greet, the only downside on my experience is that my audience can't hear the audio of the video i presented",1
It has so many error are shown.,1
Good,2
Important study,2
Face a lot of connection error and server problem,1
My mic and camera is not totally working. Please take an immediate action for this.,0
Good,2
So many bugs on voice after the new update other than that everything's fine can't give u 5* cause of the update bugs please fix it,1
This is a new ingenious tool that every progressive needs.,2
It's nice to be able to connect w work to answer a quick question from my phone or catch a meeting when we are on the go.,2
Nice app but some glitches are coming when meeting,1
Functinal and a decent UI,1
"Total failure! Useless audio chopped into shreds. Same with video. The downoad took nearly an hour, and things got worse after that! A total waste of two useless hours, after trying it! I give up - dont buy it, folks!",0
"A review after using this app during the whole pandemic. Overall this app is the best within all of it's kind. Pros--- This app has many features like recording live classes , using white board , giving assignment, scheduling reccuring classes etc. Cons--- This app has issues regarding network connectivity. Sometimes that does not allow to join a meeting. We are removed automatically from meeting. Excluding this the app is the best and most recommended by me.🥰",2
This app is good but sometimes the meeting don't join so I rate 3 star but this app is almost good,1
I HATE SCHOOL,0
Unable to receive groups notifications after upgrade.,0
Really useful we can never forget the zoom app after the pandemic because it really has done an outstanding performance to experience the reality,2
It takes more time to update. Please check these problem.,0

Unable to attend VC inspite of several attempts.,0
What a wow... So ever helpful🙏🏾😇,2

"This app is good, but sometimes I am facing various problems. At first, I am unable to on my mic and when I am trying to join the class I have automatically left from the meeting and it's showing fail to join and I was not able to join the class. This app is very disgusting. Please improve the bugs of this app...",0
Video was fine but I had trouble with clearly understanding what was being said. The audio was an issue .,2
"The features are amazing,  know participants number and location,  record voice, manage , mute mic, block person or the conference. ..international option. ...",2

Very nice app I like This app very much with this app we chat with our Friends without mobile number and we also call them this is very useful app as we study online with the help Microsoft teams so I Am giving 5 stars to this App and it's service is very nice ...........,2
It is agood applications for doing business meatings,2
I can give 5 stars but only one is here as the mic doesn't work properly it doesn't work at all i am neither able to open it nor close it.,0
Great tool for sharing info and files. Team meeting screen size can be improve though. Not able to expand as big as zoom meeting. Can be challenging for those using laptop for meeting.,2
"Audio was not good; i was unable to communicate verbally and there was significant feedback with some who were able to speak, making hearing & understanding them extremely difficult.",0

"I used GTM with no trouble in the past. Then recently, like some of the reviews I am seeing, I could not get the system to work. It failed to connect. My annual membership was just renewed. New buyer beware, there is NO REFUND if it doesn't work. We will find a different platform for our business.",0
"App was working fine when I downloaded it, and then the next day when I tried to use the app it kept me at the screen that says ""We're getting things ready for you"", and then never launch",0
"I could hear the meeting, but they couldn't me",1
Osm 😱😱😱😱😱 aap i am so amazed,2
"Not a friendly user for a student like me!!! It takes a lot of buttons in order to go to the ""Chat"" section. Update: And when i set my screen into a landscape because spmeone is presenting during our meeting, my icon gets in the way and i can't move it to somewhere else so that i can read the whole screen without a hasle. Fix it Please.",1
"After I plug the ears phone, speaker still on.",0
Why sharing audio with screen is not available in android?? This is only reason I am giving one star. Pls fix this problem so I can share video and audio both from my gallery,0

"There's this one issue. Whenever i try to press on my profile to edit it, Nothing comes on, Even the side menu doesn't show, but whenever i log in from my Parental Figure's phone, It shows everything and has the calendar and all of the stuff like that. But for me it only shows the 'More' option which only contains the 'Cast' option. That's my issue, i hope it gets fixed in the future :) Edit: All of my issues were solved, Thank you so much :D",2
"It was a great app but in mobile, view only speaker option is no longer available and hence it is of no use now. Can we expect this feature anytime soon or should we find some other app?",0
Sometimes the audio is not clear and the presentations are sometimes blurry.,1
Its a good app but......it lags a lot as I am a student it. I have many issues with the app but other than that it's a good app for students,1
great 👍 job,1
Good,1
App crashes all of the time and the sound/video stalls with regularity disrupting the flow of mertings/classes. Had to switch to another company's app and found the 'support' with GoToMeeting unhelpful.,0
gud,2
"This is an update to my previous review. I reinstalled the app and changed the setting that caused the app to open as soon as I turned on my PC. I also unsubscribed from recieving email updates. Based on about 32 hours of virtual meetings with very few but manageable glitches, I am now much happier using Lifesize.",2
"The messy internals due to my company's third party signup made this a nightmare. I was given the all-clear with 2 different emails but I still can't sign in for days. When it suddenly worked, my helpdesk had to email me because the system somehow didn't let me know. And this was not isolated; 3 other team members suffered this. Also, I was held at figurative gunpoint to install this or else. I didn't have much of a choice.",0
Just as bad at tracking you as Facebook itself. If you value your privacy do not use this app. If you value freedom of speech in no world should you use any Facebook product.,0
Cant understand.. login.. in my account not any activities.. where shoud i go to see people or news,0
I do feel that i want to be responsible with my acount but i will always respect all persons op,0

"Good but not great... you can't set themes, you can personally message, etc. It's ad-free though... I like that. The new UI is kinda all over the place though... overall, 2 and a half stars... since I can't give a half star, it's rounded of to 3.",1
"The app seems to work smoothly in general and I haven't had challenges with glitching or spontaneous shutting down. Having more participant videos visible than my screen is formatted for, however, means that I cannot see the other participants as there is no way to scroll through pages of participants. I also find it distracting that the screen flashes gray when jumping between active speakers in the active speaker mode. This is particularly a problem when we are having quick moving discussions.",2
"I am able to attend my classes NOT very easily and it is kinda very safe to use. But there is one issue, My calendar takes hell lotta time to load and I keep on pressing ""join"" again and again but I still join after 2 minutes.",1
"There is three major bugs in this app from new update that I have found 1. If some one left meeting, it shows joined in place of left 2. If we are use WebEx in multi vindos mode, there is shows only blank slides. And After reopen current meeting still it shows blank and there is nothing to operation there is no option to left meeting Due to this, user have to force stop the WebEx and rejoin to meeting. 3. Sometime attendees can't able to send message. Please fix this bug as sson as possible..",2
Good connectivity,2
"At first I was very satisfied with the app. But recently whenever I try to share my screen with my students I left the meeting. There was no network problems. I tried deleting the catche, deleting user data and rejoining but the issue continues. Otherwise worth 5 star rating",1
Fine,0
Battery Drain my phone was at 100% when I started the app an hour later it was 75% looking in settings under battery use it displays this app as high battery use is this app!,0
Hi google I have a suggestion if you could add who to chat with on In-Call messages cause when teacher asks a question and tell us to put the message in chat. Some students will copy. So if you could add that option it would be good.,2
"For a first time experience it was by far smooth. Yes a few glitches or lagging on opposite end calls, but all in all was easy to use. Would definitely recommend.",2

The app auto fills the meeting ID incorrectly. Every time you edit the mistakes it continues to auto fill incorrectly. Repeatedly have to correct the mistakes.,1
This app drains my network too much! 1.5 gb of network only on one class which lasted for 1 hour 30 mins?!I don't know if this is normal but u guys should definitely fix this.,1
Nice app but I am having problems with setting background..... Other wise it is nice,2

"Not suitable every time fail. I don't know, why made this.",0
Webex is not good for mobile devices. It requires users to type in way too much meeting info instead of simply allowing me to go to my personal room after I sign-in. Users need to sign into their own meeting rooms about 3-4 minutes in advance. Webex should also auto-recognize me when I'm accessing the meeting through a corporate Webex app...poor integration. The app worked pretty well after I got through the burdensome sign-in process.,0
Not user friendly if option is made to just use provided webmeeting link to access. Almost forcing to install the app.,0
"Mostly Great, though the overall layout of the app can be a bit tricky to navigate for people such as myself with cognitive challenges. But all in all a great app.",2

The recent update made this app totally useless. It hangs and just upsets me. Bring back the older version and layout. This new update seems like a step back.,0
This app. Is great when you got to take care of business.,2

"Very bad experience on foldable phone (Galaxy Fold 2). Worse than any other chat app. Tries to utilize the two panes of the foldable phone, but fails miserably. It does not respect the phone option whether to show the app as two pane or one pane. It tries to be two pane always. However, when opening it through notifications, it opens as single pane app. In this single pane mode, most options simply do not work. You cannot even open a chat. I filed a bug, but I do not believe it will be fixed.",0
"Great app. I regularly use this for our development scrum meetings. It works flawlessly, very neat UI & easy to use.",2

If multiple types of phone experience this overheating issue, it's the app. Saying it's the manufacturer when the phone only has a problem with this app is like going to an optometrist for a broken foot.",0
Good app. Should include optiobs for custom backgrounds and blur for video calls like the desktop version,2
This is very good app but this app voice is not working,2
Zoom us a great app. I felt like I was virtually in school but the problem is that I could'nt hear anyone and nobody ciuld hear me.,2
1. Add 'rotate screen manually' option to rotate whenever need in accordance to view without changing device's screen rotation settings. This will help too much. 2. Keep meeting codes visible which was joined within last 7 days as 'recently joined' tab. This will help to join a certain meeting quickly without creating new meeting.,2

Have had 1 to 16 other participants in meetings and we all had good experiences as program highlights the speaker. This matters because many of the speakers had masks on since other people in there respective rooms! I definitely refer it to friends and family!,2

"WebEx constantly causes the person controlling another computer, to freeze and lose control. Additionally it the other user has WebEx window open. It prevents the person controlling, to click that area, but there is no indication to the other user that a WebEx window is there..? WebEx should create a outline or 10÷ opacity box where the other users WebEx windows are so the person controlling can ask the other user to move window.

Good,1
This was very easy to use & will use it again. It's a lot better than going to an appointment and waiting. It came in very clear only had a slight bump & that I think was the internet not the application.,2
Buggy. Deal breaker was that the general room never loads. Just spins forever. Also not intuitive in that if someone calls you from teams it appears as a phone call and there was no way to tell I was in a teams call or a cell call. I also don't want teams to be active unless I have the app open just like on my PC. Makes me accessible to people I may not want to be accessible to at all hours. Hard pass.,0
Horrible app. I signed up tried to go to a meeting and told me to log in then said my password was wrong after I just made it so I knew it was right then I tried to change it thinking maybe I accidentally hit a wrong letter when making it nope it told me I couldn't use same password even tho it told me it was wrong. I uninstalled and will not recommend,0
Its good app and help me conducting a traning and its very nice yestarday only. I have cracked an intreview and a got selected in BYJUS FASTESTED LEARNING APP WHICH makes a children to understand clear concept about each and every step .osam marvouls nice good,2
Video & sound are exceptionally clear & the app's key format is user friendly.,2

The app is best for online class. But the only problem is once i update the app it takes a lot of time to open again for which i got late for my classes many times. It takes about one hour. Pls fix this problem,1
I have been facing serious issues in opening refference material of the assigned assignment since the last update i hope you will look after the problem and fix it problems as soon as possible.,2

More log,1

Would give more but one thing of disturbing: When the app runs in the background on my smartphone (24h/day) my status remains available. Didn't find out how to deactivate that. So people think I'm online when I'm sleeping.,1
Works very well for work meetings. Love that I can access call meetings off my phone for my convienence,2

It's great for conferences when everyone can't be in one place. Also great for doing presentations to coworkers.,2

"It's useless. Zoom and Skype are better. This is a lame meeting app. You can't record your session easily. Keeps opening new tabs for no reason. Moreover, you need to try really hard to find your settings all over the place. Yes, settings are not in just one place. It's all over. And the software on desktop installs in a nonesense folder where you need to dig hard to find your stuff. Why not just in C:\Program Files??? Why not?",0
Nice,2
Best app I have ever used it's so cool and it's very easy to do some hard meetings,0

"Like to view all participants, instead of just 4 at a time. Thx for asking! Thanks. Now I can view 9 participants at a time. Like to record audio of meetings. Non-host?",2
The app is good but I am giving it 3 stars because this app is not good for studying. 1.First thing is that the teachers can't see the student's name. 2.Second thing us that there is no message box for teachers to write notes for students. 3.Third thing is there is no thing for presentation of screen. I think for studying Google meet app is good than Go To meeting.,1
"Great Meeting Leader, but audio & video kept going in and out.",1
Want to development of app!,1

I don't like this app at all... After the recent update it is not working properly at all.. When I join a meeting it shows u cannot join.. It even gets stuck in between a lot of times,1
Pathetic app. Not able to sign in. Not able to join the meeting. It appends additional numbers when i am trying to type in the meeting ID. Pathetic,0
"Works mostly, but whenever I try to screenshare on the newest version of Android it won't let me switch to another screen. Makes it impossible to demo apps to potential customers",1
"I use Zoom for a variety of reasons/settings/types of meetings. Overall, I think Zoom works well but I have noticed some things that maybe could use improvement but I'm not sure if they are caused on Zoom's 'end' or not.",2

High battery consumption,1

Time spend good,1
Couldn't get our picture to the presenter but we could see him. We could hear and see him. He could only hear us. We could also see his presentation of documents.,2
ok,2
Excellent only negative is that I cannot find a way to resize or relocate pop ups aside from that brilliant but lately the video is so jerky as to be unusable it vibrates up and down at about 10fps,1
It's a great app but I can't join the call when I click the link or even when I type the code,1

It could be fine but there is a challenge when it comes to make presentation. Webinar problems not good at all.,1
"This used to be a very good app but the past two months I've had issues. Problems with connection, staying connected, volume is so low at times and some times, i can't hear anything.. It's like there's no sound at all. I know it's not my phone, because other sounds will come through.",0
Best meeting app in the world but nowadays teams is getting worse because nowadays we are not able to open assignments in phone and my friends can't open their camera while doing class on desktop or laptop so is you will fix all this I will change my review.,2

"The voice and visual quality severely distorted, disrupted the delivery, the meeting. I missed most of the message due to the repetitive distortion.",0
I love this app. Very professional!,2
Stay tuned is not a description of what is being updated. If you're not going to tell me what you changed I'm not going to update anything. I got burned by Firefox devastating destruction of the best browser. Stop hiding what you plan to change. After using several virtual meeting apps it's clear that GoToMeeting is a distant second choice to zoom. Don't waste your time with this.,0
Can't signin to my own account.. The thing is they (qspiders) are teaching software in this useless software n not to mention the other useless app Skillrary.,0

I only rated 4 stars because sometimes when i disconnect and joined again i see myself in there so please fix that,2
Good,2
"This app does A LOT. That said, I feel it falls short on being the perfect collaboration app. I think it needs Push to Talk (PTT) functionality and shopping lists (for my wife and I at the grocery store, or running to get lunch for my coworkers). I also wish it had more fluid UX in the dashboard when dealing with shared tasks and calendars. Good but not GREAT.",2
There should be allowance to see who all is on a meeting,1

Great app just when my teachers assign homework I can't access the documents in the assignment,2

"Changed to 2 stars because of MAJOR messaging issue: replies in the message notification section WHILE NOT ALREADY IN THE APP are literally being sent TO THE WRONG PERSON/GROUP. Unfreaking acceptable & embarrassing to have private conversation broadcast to large group. Also, turned on dark mode by itself. USED TO generally be reliable. Getting this kind of app right is difficult, but some problems can't happen. Getting bumped out of meetings in the middle of them is fairly common on all devices",0
The audio needs to improve. Nothing could be heard. I had to put my ear right next to the phone to be heard or hear anything,1

Poor sync between apps on PC and android/iOS device: calls show on PC but often fail to do so simultaneously on handheld devices that are logged in to the sme account + notifications that are seen on PC do not expire on cellphone,1
I love zoom over any other app I've used. It's helped me stay connected in my recovery groups. It's so easy to isolate when I'm depressed and being able to connect even when I don't feel like it helps me through the tough times,2
Wonderful app,2

After they decided to enable 2 factor, it goes into a loop for awhile so i end up having to pass in multiple verification codes to only need to re-enter my password AGAIN and go through this process multiple times until i finally get in.

Oo amazing,2
I love this app because I can easily get in touch with the staff at Herkimer College. I like how it is completely free and there are no ads. I am constantly using this app. It is very easy to use and I can use it wherever I am. This app is 100 percent safe and I can talk with my professors privately on this app.,2
Good,2
Bobby,1
I would like to give five stars because overall it's pretty cool but it might just depend on the phone I have a Google Pixel 6 and it works fine for everything else but when I'm on video and audio for my 1 hour therapy it gets so hot and sometimes they say they can't hear me even though my microphone is on I don't know.,2
When someone is sharing the screen some part of the screen gets hidden behind our own tile it creates a problem please solve this issue,1
So useful 👌👌,2

"There is a lot to like but a few really irritating issues. I love the ability to connect to SharePoint because I hate SharePoint and this significantly reduces the need to go into SharePoint. I also like the collaborative aspects. But I absolutely hate the fact that a meeting I have declined shows up in my chat and I get constant notifications. Also, when I sort a list of documents and then open one and return to the list - I have to sort it again. Wish it would stay the way I had it.",2

It's good but the attendees present we can't see all of them and to display their name we have to go to all the time to participants and To admit also in this tedious process the app will hang and ask for closing in between the class.... I am a teacher I am feeling too difficult to manage students in this app. To mute and unmute every one we should have the option very handy and finally if god's network available only we could work with teams.But not in other apps. And even for screen share,1

A comparable app to the Zoom app. The only downside is the multiple layered usage agreement that you have to wade thru and agree to in order to use the app. Wading thru the user agreement almost stopped me from installing and using the application.,1

Zoom is good but there some things to learn like the sound isn't clear enough and it buffers. It needs to be sorted out for some reason. So I can't tell at all honestly speaking. It is a good app still!,1

"Its a good app as an appointment setter,  but I would not use it for conferencing since it does not use data, it still a legacy app that tie into the cellular silos.  Setup or monitor your conferences and use the service online with Google+ Thats what I have setup for my Organization.  Also for techies and developers,  join.me is much better",2
It kept cutting in and out. My video kept stopping and I have to keep putting it back on,1
I like not needing a desktop telephone and simply using my computer for that purpose. I also like setting up video calls through my calendar. The process works great.,2
"Audio quality is poor, gets disconnected regularly.",1

"Please add that we can save a link. We use only one link in our class, and every time to meet we search the link in group chat to join, what is purpose of huge blank space in home screen of Google meet if we can't put and save the link there?",0
I appreciate this app and it is quite reliable. It brings many of us together. I thank Google and suggest to bring more advancement to this app. 😊😊😊😊,2

"Needs to improve for the online classroom. Why is it so difficult for a parent to use this? I set up a regular gmail for my child and still wasn't able to log on Meet. I had to go back to using mine. Also, there are multiple classes everyday, I wish we just save the code instead of typing all 9 letters everytime. This is difficult for a mother of multiple children with Meets around the same time.",0

Overall the app is working but please do this. It's a necessary to working in this app because I'm a student. What the ....??????i think you got my point.",1
Very good app and very helpful for my studies,1
really good. but the passcode option on mobile apps (office phones) needs to be looked at. it asks for the code after a call has been answered. Bit annoying to wait for the passcode pop up to show up every time I open the app.,2
"Interface and notifications are just fine. Could use a bit more functionality. Takes up a lot of memory, even when idle.",2
Not all goood app it's worst it took half hour to join class it's showing error my network is very good but also not it's not coming 🤬🤬😡,0

"Teams on Android is great except one thing. Let's say you have a chat open, then switch to another app. You get a notification of a new message in that chat. If you go back to Teams, where the chat's still open, the new message isn't there. Or lately, only the new message is there but anything between the last seen and new are missing. You must exit the chat and reopen it to get the new messages. It gets tiresome quickly.",2
"I am a student & Google meet is a nice app for me, especially for my online classes... but nowadays I can't hear others voice in my device.. I updated meet, reinstalled..also checked my other apps sound, they're working.. now am struggling to attend an online class😔 please clear this problem...plz",1
"I'm not having a good experience using lifesize, I can not seem to connect when I have my appointments",0
"You need to work seriously on the app,first it gets installed after 4-5 attempts then there is voice issue, then the one who's attending the meeting got left all of sudden out of nowhere.For students to opt this seems really hard.",0

"The sound is terrible in all our meetings with echos, sound going in and out, it's terrible. Also, some times the sound is not in real time meaning, you can see people's mouths moving and the sound comes later. Another thing is when I start my video it cuts off several times and i have to restart it several times before it finally stays on. Whats up with all that?",1
My first time using the app and I had no problems everything was great the sound was awesome I could hear everyone that was talking and they could hear me.i will definitely be recommending this app to all my friends! Thank you!,2

The web version of this on desktop world great. But mobile web and the app are both very buggy. On two different devices the mobile web version losses voices with more then 2 people in the room.

"22OCT21 - I am VERY Grateful to have Zoom on my phone. Zoom still remains my primary means of being in touch with ""the outside"" world. The 'lockdown' may have loosened up for others, not having a vehicle myself it's still the same for me. Gratefully, having Zoom let's me see folks I wouldn't otherwise get to see. Whether it's a couple peeps at a time, or a whole meeting, Zoom makes it possible for me to attend. I just wish I knew how to make it so others could hear my singing bowl. 😔",2

Superb recommended for the teacher who are taking online classes no ads thank you team zoom,2
This app is just a hack to make you download it. I do NOT recommend this.,0
"Great 👍 Thx,",2
It always logs me out everytime,0
Meeting is needed but I donot like Online class,0
Great and cheap no money needed when you use the HD call,2
Utilizes a lot of net.,0
The meeting was okay but I could not get the audio to connect to my Bluetooth devices. The audio would only transmit through the cell phone speaker.,1
Good app,2
Worst app ever it needs very high speed to run a meeting unlike Microsoft Teams on which you can take meeting with less speed,0
Very nice,1
Good,2
Very good app,2
I appreciate this app but only give 3 stars because it has a problem in which I cant hear others what they are saying so please how can I fix it.,1
Always exllect I am used 2 years no problem no hang .. amazing app to meeting .. use please this app .. 😊😊,2
Good app in general have a big potential. 1-can you add the same trick as whatsapp where you touch and scroll right to reply to a specific line in a conversation. 2- when in a meeting switching from speaker to ear is a struggle.,1
I don't see any point of this app. Not possible to join an already established room. This app is only an advertisement,0

Poor,0
Great sound and video quality,2
Uses a lot my data and is poorly optimised,0
"This app is nice but I face some problem in connecting, my net pac is also no over and I am disconnecting so that's why I gave it 3☆☆☆ (stars).",1
Can not open the attachment...same issue is for more than months,0
Kept logging us out,0

This have many issues please check IT for example my video camera is always shows it cannot open etc,0
All is good 👍. But I can't change my background in mobile 😭. Please fix this this issue .,1
I gave 1 star because my was installing it take 3days in my phone there is full network then also it take 3days to install please do something,0
This app keeps on hanging all the time and never works properly...and it keeps removing me from the meeting without reason. Also it does not let me unmute,1
"Both the audio and video components could use some work. Video buffered more than it didn't. Audio is tricky as well, works well for a bit, then you can't hear anything at all. Fix that and it'll be much, much better.",1
The app is having a very bad audio and video quality,0
This is a very interesting tool. Easy to use and access meetings as scheduled. I encourage all people to learnbhow to use such a tool to make gains on time and maximise on technological innovations to deliver on their services.,2
Good,0
Asanga,1
"like this app because it keeps work activity seperate from friends. moreover, the privacy features of work updates, announcements, camapigns are great.",2
"Every update brings more issues. This app isn't for communication, it's there to waste time fixing and restarting and waiting for lag to be resolved. Why's the one on iOS better ? EDIT: Got worse than ever.",0
It's good,2
Very nice application 👍👍👍,2
This App is very Cool but can you add something 1.Add change Host -when you become host you can change other become host not you 2.Add present Smooth video -make it smooth That it For me if this been added i will give 5 Star Rating 😊😊😊,1
It was good at first but after this new feature called cortana I am Not able to see any pdf on teams 😫 Just remove this feature 😡,0
عالی,1
"We have run into a ton of issues using Webex. In comparison, Zomm is very easy to use and navigate. It also allows the instructor to utilize break out groups better as well. Not of fan of this.",0
"Best app in the world. There are so many functions to connect meeting , when my network is good . I am a student using this app about 6 months. Take less net on meeting always allowing to hear clearly",2
Excellent,2
Great app,2
There is a provision in the app that without admin's permission no participate can present his screen and a end meeting button in admin's screen should have.,2

Very clean window for the presentation and image and sound are very clear.,2

Does not sync properly and shows old message as unread.,0
"No support for Microsoft Internet Explorer means it's not useful for us to use in supporting many of our clients and prospects! Love the service, if IE support was added it would meet our needs perfectly.",0
"The app itself functions fine, and sound quality is generally good. However the lack of android auto integration is a major letdown. Incoming calls cannot be answered and meetings cannot be joined (obviously i expect these to be audio only for safety reasons).",0
This app suck not only the I hear the echo it keep on dismiss without any reason I hate this stupid app 😤 when I'm done with only class the chat option also doesn't work I was marked absent such a stupid app,0
Audio and video was very clear. There were no glitches. Fairly easy to set up and join the meeting.,2
"I'm surprised that this has such high ratings considering the app is absolute garbage. The audio is so unreliable that we just ask the meeting attendees to call via traditional phone. The video is buggy and slow. Audio is not compatible with Plantronics headset. Compared to other similar apps like WebEx or Ring, this is a shameful app.",0
Good,2
Lag,0
I couldn't join a meeting after downloading it just imagine it kept saying no internet connection. I was very distgusted wasted my money,0
Not able to open,0
"Hardly using the paid version. Sound issues, gets stuck and etc. $149 wasted",0

It is very good app. But it cut alot of time inside the session,2
"Works well, very few issues with the app. Many useful features allow for quick collaboration and file sharing",2

"The app kept telling me I needed to register when I tried to join a meeting for which I had the codes to enter and had previously registered! Once in, the audio & video fluctuations made it difficult to completely follow &/or understand the message...",0
"Buggy as hell (chat doesn't always update cross platform) and downloads don't automatically save to the default download folder but instead to some mystery location still unknown to me (using a Pixel 3). I do appreciate the attempt to bring such a robust, feature-rich app to mobile, but the actual implementation feels more like an early beta release, and not like a finished product for public use.",0
Unable to reach network error,0
Good,2
Fun,2
Super,2
"Not sure what changed, but I can't send messages after navigating away from the app and going back in. I can type out a message but hitting the send button does nothing. I have to completely close the app and then go back in to send. Then it will happen again if I navigate away from Teams. It's quite frustrating.",0
This app is really helpful for meetings. Thanks to Google for this app. It's easy to use. Just go for it.,2
Too goid,2
If there would be 0 star option I would hive 0 star because in this app it is showing the we will have the effects option after update but there is no effect option,0
Facebook,1
I can't see myself during the meeting when I'm using my phone and I don't understand why,1
Service is very slow.,1
I really like this app but am not getting push notifications when i have a message or call from TEAMS. I am on the go much and need to know if someone is trying to reach me. As long as i have this opened in the background then i will get all notifications. I also have to keep siging in via fingerprint if I've been away for 15 minutes without the app opened or if I allow my phone to turn off.,1
It was a fantastic experience to meet with friends through this app..,1
Good within the time allotted,0
"Pretty self explanatory...for my 1st time using it, I wish I knew some of the icons the app used meant, such as the the speaker's box button that looked like an expansion icon instead of a collapse button. I had 2 play around with the settings 2 figure out the basics as an attendee. Thank goodness I didn't boot myself out of the virtual meeting.",1
"Best conference call app out there, period.",2
"Quite good app. But I'm not sure about privecy. Please clear me one thing, can organiser of the meeting can see the personal chat between two attendies.",1
Audio wouldn't play through headset,0

This is the meeting place for me and my therapist. I have dissociative identity disorder which is also called multiple personality disorder. For me to have a stable place to go and meet during this time of covid is vital! This app is awesome!! DO IT it works on my phone better than it does on my computer!! (it is that stable),2
I don't know why but there is some issue with the assignments section You can't really open assignments in mobile and sometimes they don't even load on a PC too I request you to please look into this,2

This app is ok but a little problem when i need to upload my home wrk or answer script its not responding so please make it easy so my teacher will not scold m e of late submission either that it is a good app,1
Very good. But I have one issue when I share an audio clip it doesn't give the sound,2
Nice application but can do more changes like in lecture I don't want to see my face. Most of time our video is off so that big square box occupied space and it's irritating on mobile. Can you please put one option whether I want to see my face or not. Thanks,2
"I really had an enjoyable experience using this app. It was the 1st time my using it and it was very intuitive. I obtained the necessary information I needed while using the app, and the clarity it provided on my mobile device (S9 +). No issues cited.",2
This app is great and useful,2
The best conferencing service and a fantastic app to go along with it. very simple to use and quality was near perfect,2
Some time voice problem.,1
This app is nice tho but its not letting me to make a meeting i dont know why please fix it thank you,1
"Get to know who you work and stay on top of your company's news, postings, promotions, acknowledgements, photos, profiles, anniversaries, Party Invitations. Easy to use 👍👍👍👍👍",2
It's a nice app but it takes many network like if we do one meeting it is taking 200 mb....... Please resolve this problem................. If I do 5 classes it takes 1 GB........ My review ends till this.... Because if I will tell then also they will not resolve this problem..........,1

"The new version of meet is okayish , but not as good as zoom . If it would try to be like zoom , then it would be so good .",1
What the he'll in this update all are worse you'll had moved the panel to the left and the chat is small the before one which was on the top was good and did you'll test it before releasing 🤔 and even when we press on the typing box it moves toward up Pls fix those issues or rever it to the before version it is worst in this update,0

I am trying to download but play store don't approved for installation. So I do not installed the app. Please help me for installation,0
Very bad,0
easy to use,1
"I love the Zoom service but this app could be better. I almost never have drop outs with this service and have never had any surprise meeting guests. It would be helpful to have a connection strength meter like the desktop app does. It would also be helpful to be able to order the windows manually on the 4-up pages, or put your own window last, or make it small floating in the center .",2

I hope for the next update android support video sharing with audio.,1
"Weak audio. In several recent Webex Meetings, I've found the audio volume to be very low. With everthing turned up to max, the meeting participants are still nearly inaudible. No such issue with Zoom, Meet or Teams meetings.",0
Choppy n freezing 🥶,0
I like this app but I want background please 😭 🙏 😫 😩 😢,2
I've only used it once to have a video conference with my professor and one other classmate during the coronovirus situation. It ran smoothly for the most part. A few times the video froze for a few seconds and other times cut out the audio for a few seconds. Another issue was that my classmate's icon would replace my professor's screen for a few seconds throughout the session. Overall the experience was good and I'm very grateful to have a way to get help at this time.,1

This app was better before. It had a way to not disturb anyone and chat to the host but the updates have disabled this feature. I can't even contact through the emojis which is sad.,1
It's easy & helpful app,2

It's an awesome way to let team members be informed!,2

"Best app for online meeting, classes. In mobile version some issue. I thought it will clear soon by ms team",2
I love this application but it's hangs sometimes,2
This app is great. But had problems of late when my ipad updated to version 15.2. since then I am unable to access. Would like to hear some resolution from developer.. thanks,1
Good,2
call out to authenticate phone feature doesnt work at all (12/3). Duo authentication via callback stopped working as of Dec. Cant use app cause I cant sign in to my company account via Duo authentication.,0
"Quick to set up via mobile phone, no issues connecting to the meeting, though a few bandwidth issues and audio connection issues (probably my WiFi, and Bluetooth headset to blame). Hope to have an even better experience once I fix the computer, regardless I'm impressed with the experience on smartphone. Thank you for helping to connect the professionals and people who need them during these trying times.",2
"It was a little hard to figure out how to actually join the chat because the organiser had audio problems. However, once l got the hang of it l was able to contribute to the meeting by typing my response or questions in the chat.",2

This is app video is very poor quality And it automatically disconnects when there is no signal And if share a video in screen share the video will be very pool and will starts strucking.,0
"Despite the fact that I am a paid workplace subscriber, I cannot record meetings. This is absolutely unacceptable. The fact that a free zoom user can do something a paid user here cannot is ridiculous. Get your act together Google. *EDIT* The reply from Google is ridiculous. The record function should be a basic feature including for free users. The fact that I'm paid user and cannot record a meeting is ludicrous.",0

Useless app,0
The line is choppy,1
Interesting. Reception not so good. Thanks for sharing. Good job Raymond.,2
I'm using a Samsung Galaxy M32 and I can't seem to change my virtual background. There is no button to change background. Please advise.,0

Not as good as Zoom. Fewer features. Can't see everyone in a gallery view.,1
Interesting.,2
"Good for what i need it to do with my team, but I'm not a fan of when it's open on my computer and the messages i've already seen come in an hour or so after. Or some messages may not load. Good app overall.",2
"Annoying. It is just like a texting app but with more things to traverse (meetings, chats, etc...). Also, there are the NON-STOP missed activity emails. And you can't block them! I'm ignoring the conversation for a reason and now I have to constantly receive emails about it. And you can't delete the conversations! Really don't like this app.",0
"Feedback popups aren't part of my job, thanks",0

"Hello, big problem with adding photos from a gallery. Tapping ""photo album"" then ""please wait"" takes extremely long time to load. Samsung a71 5g. Please fix",0
Okay with it,2
Overall is good. Only thing is being able to see everyone at once doesnt work with different phone types. And if you have multiple people speaking the camera will bounce with them and its frustrating. Overall the app does work decently. Update: new multi screen is convenient!!,2
Yes,0
"The new update is troublesome. Could openany of the attachments. Tried installing and deleting the app multiple times. Still issue is not solved. Also reading progress doesn't work properly, couldn't see recording option. It works fine in desktop though. Many students are using it via cellphones,this app need to improve its performance in cellphones too.",0
Good on Android and ios but bad on Windows platform. On windows it's v slow and takes too much time for every action even on 8 GB Ram computer.,1
Data usage is very high,0
Very efficient and good tool.Helped a lot during the COVID time.,2
Glad they fixed the recording feature in the app...it works now so you can do the whole meeting from your phone.,2
"Love this! I am no longer using the other conference company. As soon as I figure out how long it takes to sync contacts back to my phone,  I will rate it higher.",2
It is a very good app . It is very easy to use .,2
Too much lag in running the app or switching the screen.,1
It was a nightmare to get it to work after I switched phones. Authenticator wouldn't work and the only way I could get it to work was I had authenticator on my old phone so I was able to use the generated number there. Make sure you keep your old phone to get Teams to work on your new phone. Works well but it is a little slow on my phone...not sure if it is my phone or the app,0
Both my tablet (android) and my Galaxy S9 hate this app. I always have one problem or another. It also always seems to be different every time I log on. So frustrating.,1
"Notifications do not clear if you open the message on desktop app. Needs to sync better, I have to re open messages on phone to get rid of messages.",0

Buggy and annoying. Can't get blue tooth to consistently connect even when blue tooth works with other apps. Inconsistent performance and audio quality.,0
"It was challenging not being clear on how to operate. I had a staff work with me and I kept going in and out testing, clicking touching trying different ways that it worked out. I believe technology has went to far attempting to reinvent the wheel. The Invitation of the meeting is what was the best part that it came so simple.",1
"When will I be able to finally register 1 minute audio messages without being worried of them being cancelled? (And forcing me to do it again?) This is really unacceptable, an enterprise app like this should never have this kind of issues",0
I love this app,2
takes so long to open. dark doesn't always work. very laggy when switching to different convos or calendar,0
"At first I wasnt able to open files and assignments, but I redownloaded and then updated and now it has no problem.",2
"I like the mobile app but there are a few things that the mobile app doesn't do, which it should. It does not update chat to show ""seen"" when the chat has already been viewed in the Windows app. (You have to go into each chat thread separately to unhighlight them.) Like the Windows app, it does not always remove the Activity flag even when you've viewed the Activity in either a chat or in the Activity screen.",1
"its workable, but the controls and stuff are confusing, its very complicated and very laggy sometimes",1
Good,2
Life destroyed Online classes,0
Quality perfected at a ridiculously low price with the best on hold music you'll ever hear on a conference call... And the ultimate luxury of not having a pin that sounds like a social security number for particular calls if that is your desire,2
Excellent to use this,2
Thayaddran,1
Just installed the app and I haven't used it much.,2
Great mobile version. It does the job on a mobile level. Our teams are often in the field for projects and this app keeps us close together and give the best ability work and collaborate withing our organisation.,2
Good connection clarity is bad.,0
"Strange, the owner of this company created Google voice, yet the app on the iPhone is much better.  It allows you to select groups you created online where the droid does not.  In addition you can only schedule calls immediately (same on iPhone).  Being kind with a 3 star rating as I love UberConference, however until those corrections are made, app is virtually useless",1

Its Really awesome app to get spoof sms to make fool other,2

Poor audio and not user friendly,0
For First few days it was good Now I am not even able to join meeting unable to access even my internet is stable. I can use other apps like YouTube and etc with my internet but in zoom every time it is showing failed to coonect zoom. Same results after reinstalling please fix it.,0

Nise,1
Good audio and video with only minor hiccups,2
You can only see webcam of one person,0
"Overally a great app & does the work as expected. However I will increase my rating once I see below features/bugs taken care. 1. When there are no participants left, still while exiting its asking, do you want to ""leave meeting"" or ""End meeting for all"". It should just end. 2. There should be a way to see who is SPEAKING, without keeping participants list open. Especially when screen sharing is on that will be very helpful.",0
Good,2
Please give us the ability to disable volume priority. It's saddening not being able to listen to music or other audio during a call. Also give us more specific notification settings for team messages such as only receiving notifs when the host posts.,1
Some time I can't get to the meet,1
Good,1
A very nice app for meeting purposes everyone should try it once.,2
I have tried to log in as requested by my organisation. It won't go beyond the basic sign in screen on my phone and won't open at all on my computer.,0

Always an issue w Audio,1
"I wished app on android would have the tool panel, so I could participate in the class ( arrows, markers, eraser etc.). All I have is ""raise your hand"" and chat with everyone (can't even select one person).",0
Updates cause problems. Needing this app for work makes it very difficult while zoom works out the kinks.,0
You can't connect to channel with link. Means 2 persons with whereby app can't communicate with each other.,0

"More efficient these days in terms of audio quality during sessions and connectivity, keep it up....",2
"Only thing that bugs me is; when I'm in conversation with anyone on Teams PC version, let's say with a Bot, my mobile rings notification with every new message even though I'm active on the PC. If I turn off notification sound then it won't ring even if I'm offline on PC. In case I don't miss anything when I'm away from PC I keep notification on but need to cope with this issue.",1

Ok,1
Webex worked perfectly. Video and audio with excellent clarity.,2
Very annoying app. Every few days I need to go thru the full login process with 2FA even tho I haven't rebooted the phone or logged out of the app. Calls ring on phone even tho I am clearly active on computer.,0
"I was surprisingly impressed. I loved the poll feature! I attended a job info session on the platform was impressed with how easy and user friendly it was. Would would prefer if the chat was more easily accessible. Like a bubble, maybe?",2
"Wouldn't let me sign in to my own account so had to join meeting externally. Sound wouldn't work on my tablet, had to get out of meeting and go in through email link. Still wouldn't let me sign in, had to join ""externally"". Sound worked, but got really low at end of meeting. And of course, you cannot adjust it in app, or maybe you can if it allows you into your own account....?!",1
Nic apps,1
Try to lower the price,2
Easy to use,2
"Every time I try to schedule a meeting, I spend a few minutes customizing the event only to be kicked out of the app saying I'm not logged in. I then have to re-login and re-enter everything. How about you either force login at the beginning or get rid of this altogether?",0

Audio is not clear.Video is also not perfect. Can improve better.,1
"Voice is not clear, it consumes lot of internet",0

Can't open or view any files after the recent update,0
I am not satisfied at all,0
Super app I am have enjoyed in this app,2
Such a great tool and option for taking on-line classes. I used the app for my first calculus class and could hear and see my professors very well.,2
"Cannot get any sound. Settings have no effect. The sound problem seems to have resolved itself. However, the video and audio portions are usually out of sync. Distracting.",0
Ok,2
Can't log out,0
Good apps,0
Disconnect... automatic and Get connected automatically in 10 sec.... Distrub with the App.. can't attend my online classes properly. from the last 7-8 days,0
Made more better zoom,0
The app always log me out and would require me to sign-in all over again; the app does not notify me when i have a message until I deliberately open the app to check.,0
"I hope you can innovate the usage of google meet like for android in terms of having a record button so anyone in the participants can do recording of any meetings in google meet, we mostly need it as a student to recall any meetings we have when we encounter some trouble in our internet connection while we are in the meeting. In additional, please develop this google meet to have a noise cancellation button for android. I hope you response to this as soon as possible. Thank you very much!",1
Had a great experience. No technical glitches.,2
"Got 2 F's because of this app not working correctly, please fix the app it is causing alot of problems, mostly that it isn't letting me attach photos to the work and it is really important.",0
"I don't like it because it's not working, i get notifications for conversations i had yesterday, or a month ago and they are coming one after another. It's very annoying because when somebody is sending a message i don't get a notification, i wil get it 2 days later.",0
"It's the barest minimum. ...and now don't have audio very often. UPDATE: The improvements since my original review really show. It works a lot better, now.",2
"Lot of bugs, No sudden response to any of action taken.Mic mute/unmute issue. My phone has 6gb Ram and Helio Gaming processor i think it's pretty enough for running this app. This app is clummsy and lag . Only the benifit is lot of members can join meetings. Litterly worst app if u fix the bugs it will the best app",0
"Good,but sound may be clear properly",1
Good,2

Fun,2
"Good app, but it doesn't have an option to use whiteboard and share images and Videos. Meeting is incomplete without being able to share your thoughts and sketches on a whiteboard, sometimes you just need to share images without sharing your phone's screen.",0
Easier to access.... anywhere! Hence... more learning opportunities can be attended. 😊,2
Very often the keyboard hiding the text field. Sometimes an update fix this but what to if now update is pending?,0
i rate this aap 04 stars,2
Convenient. Easy to use.,2

"I don't know what happens, whenever I turn on my mic to speak, the other person could hear nothing....if possible please see why it is happening",0
Good application,2
Some occasional freezing issues,1
Terrible,0
Can be glitchy sometimes hence the 3 stars but other than it can be okay when I get notifications,1
🙁,0
Too much,2
The app and video is good though.......but the real problem is you can't change the volume of meet....It's so annoying even if your device volume is down. It's need to fix asap in web and app,1
"Calendar will sometimes be missing. Another annoying feature is that it requires a code that is sent to my phone, but since the app is on my phone, I have to switch over to open my text message to view the code. Then I have to switch back, which sometimes will refresh the screen requiring a new code.",0
Nice ❤️,2

"The app is 90% perfect. There is great connection throughout my entire 1 hour prayer meeting. However, there a been a few times when the share on media content did not operate properly. It's been probably 1% of the time. It was usually operator error. But it has happened. The webex has been a great connection tool of communication.",2
I like the new update now. Very useful for the student like me. But still needs to improve little when presenting on phone the audio of the presention does not reach to other participants. And overall it is little good.........................,0
Hoping to get good results,1
Great app for business training and networking.,2
Very good app but sometimes it has glitch i have data but it writes please check your network. please fix this glitch so i gave 3 star. thanks for making a class and meeting app.,1
Should have a raise hand feature,0
I could use some little changes feels alittle clunky on the phone. Otherwise it's a great tool for companies and groups to communicate,2
"this app it's good, but notifications on phone when someone sends you a message doesn't work too well, please fix it, would be great if this works correctly",0
It's ok. But there is no light. It's full of dark when I switch on my video,1
Super app,2

very good,2
Perfect solution,2
App is nice but when the teacher shares the screen a small box is always there which shows the first letter of the name of participant which is quite disturbing And whosoever joins the meeting first becomes the host and start removing everyone .... Please solve this problem.,0
The quality of this app is excellent but I would love if some of the UI gets more improved,2

"This app is full of bugs.Whenever I have to use this app, I have sign in each time which even if doing so doesn't signed you in but just repeats the same thing to sign in. No matter how much you sign in it does not do so. Unless and until I reinstall the app and do from beginning, its no help. Please fix this bug.",0
"It works, albeit not well. Notifications can be fickle, messages just don't show up, you constantly get logged out, and of course the keyboard regularly opens on top of the input box for chat. It works. Just feels like an half-baked platform.",1
Hoping that you will also add the background feature on android devices.,1

I cannot answer phone calls using the app on my phone. It rings but doesn't show anywhere on my phone and then the call history isn't correct either.

"I was forced to use this app on my computer for work, instead of Skype, for some reason. On the computer it works OK, but after downloading and giving up Tons of info on my android I discover that it doesn't work at all without having the device make a telephone call, which my device does not do. Skype can make this call over wifi. Additionally, it doesn't even show chats, it seems. So, completely useless app for me. Also doesn't seem to save a list of conferences that you typically call so you have to keep typing in the URL.",0

Complicated app ..sometimes the chat box disappear....it is not very user friendly,0
It consumes more than 1 gb data for a meeting of 40-50 mins,0
I like the desktop version better. I can't join via phone unless everyone else is already on the meeting. Pretty stupid that I have to actually click my URL to open up the meeting and can't do this just by opening the app.,0

"Works for the most part, does what it's supposed to do. It does like to randomly switch to light theme though. Also, Teams in general (not just the mobile app) lacks some basic features which are too lengthy (and not related) to here.

"AUDIO AND VIDEO WERE FUZZY, BUT IT POSSIBLY COULD HAVE BEEN MY CONNECTION. EASY TO USE AND I LIKED THE EMOJI OPTIONS.",1
This rating is based on a one time usage. The app connected and stayed connected. The picture quality never wavered and audio was great The whole time. Connecting or joining a meeting was fast and simple.,2

Was forced by work to download app but not easy to set up. Wants you to create a group wrather than chamge then is based on updated passwords through work so once again cant login. Ironicaly thats the best part of the app is not being able to log in.,0
"Please fix the problem of ""Couldn't join the video metting"" I can't get inside of my online class",0
Good but need to improve more,1
It is good but it takes more data which was not aspected. And there are many facilities for those who using zoom from laptop or computer or ios mobiles they can share the background but those who are using mobile can't do that and this update has included games and many more apps but only for those who are using zoom on laptop our computer but not for mobile.,1

The voice kept cutting off an the picture wouldn't show sometimes.,0
"So far not much negative to say about the app. my only gripe is that i didnt see an option to view everyone all at once. you had to swipe to get through the groups of people and even then the views constantly change and therefore send you back to the first group of people. other than that, the quality of both the sound and video are pretty good s long as you have agod connection and a good device. not too bad",2

Thank you so much for reaching out.",2

There is nothing intresting in this app . It is very boring,0
Meeting was breaking a little when WhatsApp or Duo usually have no problems. Other than that the app is easy to use and straightforward. Gets the job done.,1
Worst,0
Our company uses this app all of the time and for the most part it has been very dependable for the past 2 years. There have been some minor issues That we have encountered but they were usually after a recent update of the app and life size was quick to fix the problem once we notified them. I'm giving you 5 stars.... So next year when we re-up on our contract think about giving us a discount.... Lol! Jk jk jk,2
Very nice app my school jnv Patiala Is app par,1
Cant download error messge keep popping up.,0
Vary bad,2
There should be No time limit for the meeting and there should be recording option of the meeting in phone too... otherwise the aap is good.,1
The web version is quite buggy on Mac. It just crashes when shared bandwidth with uploads/downloads/deployments. Voice and screen share are really good quality with lags in low latency. Notifications are not received at times for messages or calls. Would love to use it long term if critical bugs are fixed soon.,1
It very clear until you start moving around then you have spots where you lose connection and you get put on hold.,2
Bat boring. App .....? Loading aap download..?,1

Way to hard to join in on a meeting not realizing that it was going through this app. Probably my company's fault for not letting us know prior to the meeting that we would have to set this up. I missed half of the meeting trying to set up the app and join. A frustrating experience.,1

4 Stars because you can't see all participants in one screen on a tablet android. Hopefully Zoom 😔,2
It is good app because it gives more options which is really need to a host while handling a meeting. but there is a big problem in it. if the host removed any participant by mistake then that participant can not join again that meeting. I think you should give at least 2 chance to participants to rejoin meeting. and one more problem is that when 40 minutes complete then meeting get close automatically. so please add at least 60 minutes to free meeting. please.,0

It's a pretty good app. They lose two stars because you shouldn't be nagging users for ratings in the app store when you bill yourself has a professional enterprise level solution.,0
"This APP works great for our company. we sometimes have 20-60 people on, and it works without any issues.",2
Video good..audio ok.. But at a time only 6 members can be seen...this is the main drawback,1
There are times that the audio is not clear that i need to place my phone on my ears and I think that shld be worked on specially in important meetings like this.,1
"We're using the app at work. There is always connection issues when I need to edit something. Browsing works decent, but I struggle to edit info and make posts.",0

Veryy bad application,0

Worst app everytime it is showing that isn't responding and it disconnected me from my meeting...... And it's showing meeting is full....,0
It keeps on logging me out every other day and takes awhile for the verification text to arrive...great apps though if not for this hassle.,1

Pls fix it:),1
Excellent Experience 👍🏾,2
"It consumes too much Internet. Even after having 4 gb per day data, I cannot attend 6 hours of meeting peacefully. Literally how can it consume that much data??! Developers should not ignore this, they should work on data consumption. It also has too many bugs, Screen Sharing is not smooth, etc.....",0
"Absolute waste of time. Irrelevant notifications, constant log outs. 5 minutes plus to log back in (only 1 in 3 times successful) Uninstalled",0
Cool App!,2
"Edit for developer: I would much prefer the browser based experience. However, GTM won't recognize my Chrome browser as a Chrome browser and tells me I need to download the Chrome browser that is being rejected so that I can use Chrome browser instead of Chrome browser. Trust me, I would use the browser if could. I've cancelled my subscription and moved back to Zoom. GTM has too few features for me to work this hard at using it. [Original review:] Far worse experience than the browser based experience. Can't adjust attendee layouts. Personal preview screen is tiny. Audio is cut off when running audio from another app. Not a fan.",0
Great to be able to connect with your colleagues from so far away and the volume and sound was clear.,2
"National, international meetings work very well. Real time collaboration on complex issues are important and this software product works seamlessly.",2

I am not able to update latest version of this app and due to this problem sometimes I am unable to join meeting,0
Unfortunately,1
Kumar,1
My video kept stopping although it may have been my phone and not the actual app.,1
Literally started to get dozens of notifications for bogus calls.,0
This app is extremely good app it is so much helpful for my online class.But it have one problem that in new version we cannot permanantly change our name and if we change afterwords we cannot change.,2
Awsome,2
"The chats do not update with the desktop version. It shows new notifications and old chat that I've already read or hidden on the desktop. Otherwise, it works fine.",2
Audio not coming,0
"This is the best app ever, makes life much easier for business meetings congrats to the developer.",2
Shared screen ppt getting stuck and screen isn't refreshing....,0
Screen sharing quality is horrible. Sends and receives 360p resolution and there's no way to change that. Bring a setting like meet web page where we can change video quality.,0
Very good for conducting meeting,2

Works well on both phone and desktop. Easy to communicate with my co workers,2
Great,2
Oswald,2
I can not down load the app,0
very good,2
I don't know how but this latest version is the worst yet. My chats keep disappearing and I have to manually refresh the page just to get them to show up. All the best parts of this product are on the part people never seem to use.,0
We can't see the videos of all the participants. No navigation facilities between the videos of participants. No option to pin a particular participant's video.,2
"I've had this app on my phone for a while now, but the experience of using it has been rocky. It's definitely a pain in the..... Having to uninstall and reinstall whenever i have a meeting for work. Wanting to switch account, asking for my password then not accepting said password, saying no record and yet I'm signed in already. Try using the authenticator with it! So not a smooth process it can take several attempts, it would be quicker to use normal sign-in (when working properly).",1
Favorite.,2

"It's unacceptable that while I can join a meeting and have phone audio and computer screen sharing, I can't answer a call and add my computer to the call. I literally have to hang up, schedule a meeting with the person, and dial back in. Please add this feature. Make calls similar to a meeting.",0
"OK Can you get that presenter removing the people , so can you remove that bug fixes",0
I absolutely hate this app on my phone it always changes to audio only in the middle of the meeting and I can't see the screen or who's in the meeting. Please fix this!!! There should be an option if you would like to be audio only or not. You shouldn't be forced into that option.,0

I had report it but zoom had not fixed the problem . I am a student due to this i cant attend my classes and sometimes it is telling connecting and it does not connect,1
I have trouble with this app every time I use it. Last week I couldn't turn off the closed caption that popped up in the middle of my meeting. Today I lost video and only had audio with no buttons to try to fix it anywhere. Not very user friendly.,2
It's good but why doesn't it gives me a background even I update it 3 times.,2
Very good quality,2

Took over 5 minutes to connect to meeting on mobile network.😡,1
Poor quality and it was not working properly... And there was no fliter options to experience something new... Better use some other apps.. Thank you,0
"Consistent and thoughtfully planned App. Would be significantly improved experience if mobile app allowed maximizing screen area to presenter's slide area in landscape mode without all the unnecessary print/messages that come up, covering parts of the screen which may be a table or data that is already difficult to see/interpret.",2
Perfect,2

Google meet is a very good app you should download this app some schools are taking online classes by this app called Google meet and it has a lot of options like if the teacher has no whiteboard and the teacher needs to write something in the whiteboard the teecher just need to present and if that teaches wall is very dirty the teacher can change the background into white colour and like that and you can send messages in the chat box when your microphone is not working you just need to type,2

"It is ok but can be Improved: in particular, the quality of audio and video is not as good as with Teams or even WhatsApp......",2
It continues to buffer and break up from time to time. this program is more for business than with schools same reason I'm not a fan of it for the students. We use this at my job and the same problems I care but when you are teaching and learning with constant interruptions can be very challenging to the student,1

"Smooth transition no glitches, or delays. Solid means to communicate",2
"Good sound quality, very good for virtual meetings and discussions.",2
This was good but due to auto resolution. It's getting difficult and my camera is getting blur even if I sit near high speed net,1
There is some functionality that is slow. If I get a message notification on my phone and click to look at it all that happens is I go to a blank message tab with an infinite loading screen. The only way around it is to back out of the messages and go back in. Even then the conversation itself won't populate with the newest message until after you replied to the brief notification you saw pop up. Other than that I have no complaints,2
Very very bad,0
Awesome app,2
"It was good ,there is always room for improvement",1
"Why is it that on your last mobile update it removed the ability to adjust the volume during calls. Why would you remove the ability to control the volume.

Very useful in situations when my laptop run out of charge. I am facing issues of logging in everytime i open the app and also while attending a meeting while opening the chat section the app is asking me to log in. Request the developers to look into this problem,1
Too goid,2

"Decent chat app. Android client supports all the same features as I use on desktop. Good calendar integration with Outlook. If you don't like MS, that's okay, and once you get past that you'll see this is a good successor to Skype for Business, while being a less-obnoxious Slack competitor.",2
"Very easy to use but it's not working the network connection is very very poor the is, not to easily. Thanks",0
"The sound when people enters into the meeting was so disturbing and we can't hear some part of the lecture sessions correctly when people are entering into the meeting...( I said this because of the host sound was low and that sound was high ) please remove that sound from the application...,I think there's no use of this feature",1

"The host should have Mute All power. If not it can be really confusing with more than 5 people. It is possible the host doesn't know they have this, if available in this app. If they do then there should be an auto note that informs the host.",1
Exceptional,2
Navigating the features is a bit cumbersome and problematic.,1

This is actually a real cool and easy way to attend any type of meeting which includes even court dockets!. Living in this world we live in now with the technology and during the covid pandemic this is one of many ways we can stay connected. It still has its issues with connection and freezing up.,1
It's okay but when I click assignments It's taking a while to open and when I'm on class then im turning on my camera I can't open it and when they share screen It's black sometimes (idk why does it look like it but I got fast int) I'm only opening 1 app but it's still lagging so yeah. I'm giving it 3/5,1
Expectional,2
Sometimes my camera doesn't work at all,2

This is a very cool app for online class and meeting,1
"Terribly poor setup. [edit]...I don't want to do your job for you. Just bring someone in off the street. Tell them to set it up and test it on their phone. You will get your answers....Also, first time I used it, I had important meeting. I turn on my camera and my own video overlayed on video from other party. I hit every button I could find and still could not pull my video off theirs. I never could pull my video away so had to turn off my camera so only I could see other party. It was not two-way. Terrible. [edit again] You don't understand my issue. My video overlays 90% on top of other person in meeting. So I see myself but not them. The only way to see them is if I turn off my camera. Then obviously he can't see me, but I can see him. Frustrating because it was important meeting and this glitch was ill-timed. It should be easier to test before an important meeting starts.",0
Please add hindi captions till now that's why only 3 star if hindi language will be in caption then 5 star,1
"I really love this app. Use it 8 hrs a day to communicate with colleagues but it's been very glitchy for over a month now. It's so hard to keep in touch with my coworkers and bosses. I have updated it, uninstalled and reinstalled.... no changes.",0

It is getting better. It may be my phone. But it was going in and out with the Audio . Was not able to see the speakers when they spoke. I am so glad you had a dial in. The session was really great. Willola.,1
Poor audio,1
"Every thing is nice, except you can't share device sounds while presenting screen, But it's easy to use. It could use some improvements like; notice bar control(mic, camera, audio), This would really help me to pass time during boring math class, you know😉? Otherwise it's cool Thanks for your wonderful app!!",2
I constantly have to re sign in at least once a day. The app also does not stay in sync with viewed messages on desktop; conversations that are days old still show as bold (unread) in the app even though I viewed them on the computer when they arrived.,0
It's a very great app.I love it. But the only thing is that sometimes it kicks me off.,2
A great way to interact with clients while still being professional and saving cost of conferences. I recommend it to all who are enthused with interacting with their clients any day wherever. 👏👌,2
This app helped me a lot to do my classes but sometimes it automatically stops and shows an error occured. Because of this sometimes my meetings stops and i have to join it again . Please fix these problems. The second problem is that the voice was not clear. The video was blur sometimes. It can be some network issue. Otherwise it's a good app for doing meetings. 😉😉😉😊😊😊. So that's why i am giving it 4 stars,2
"This app is for kids and the host can do everything but this app is not bad. This app is really 👌🔥nice. That is why I give 3 stars ⭐. There are some issues for few days. After update the app, app now very cool.",1

"With the instructions I was provided, downloading the GoToMeeting app was easy. Joining meetings is easy too. So far I have only joined meetings that someone else set up. T he only thing I didn't understand at first was the fact that I needed to turn on my video; I thought it was on. Of course there was the little icon with the video camera and a slash through it; but I still didn't realize my video was off until the teacher told me.",2
It is best application in this segment and used by most professionals.,2

Based on about 32 hours of virtual meetings with very few but manageable glitches, I am now much happier using Lifesize.",2
App was realy good. But nowadays We face lot of connecting issue and we couldn't attend online classes properly. Allother apps are working but zoom is not. Highly 😥😫,1
The app now requires a code via text before I can answer calls or respond to messages. The caller hangs up before the process can complete. It won't remember device or stay logged in. Very frustrating. MSFT can do better.,0

I am so grateful for zoom. I can keep up my meetings because of it. It's been a life line. Sometimes....I do struggle with hearing everything. It gets crackling. One of these days maybe I will figure out how to get everyone on one screen. Lol. Thanks zoom!!,2

I love how simple it is to videochat or have a meeting very much recommended for school or work,2
Zoom is easier. Plain and simple.,0
I can't show my webcam  Is there a option and I can only see the webcam of who's talking not everyone It would be better if it was same as PC's interface,1
"it's a cool tool but i only get notifications when i open the app which defeats the purpose of a notification. i don't understand why they don't pop up, everything is turned on. i have a oneplus nord.",1
It is a good app but before 2-3 days I am unable to join it shows connecting but it doesn't connect please check it as soon as possible because I have losing my classes and it is very big lose for me,1
"This app is good but, while online classes are going on some disrarbence will happen so we cannot hear anything properly always it cut and it will reconnect by this we can't hear anything properly",1
Cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool,2
Good aap,1
Could not upload easily in my cellphone,1
Voice not clear sometime disturbance are there,1
Takes the pain out of conference calls. Great features. I wish sharing docs was integrated within app but hopefully that will come. Third party ways to store docs now isn't seamless or as polished as you might expect from how well rest of the app is designed.,2
"Does an ok job, audio inconsistent. Gives the option to use internet or dial in but the dial in quality is awful, volume is always low and often I have to use the internet. This isn't convenient when in transit and makes it almost impossible to conduct meetings when not at my office. The video is fine",1
Super,2
"While the app is running, my whole phone screen occasionally flickers between on and off. Started happening after I updated to Android 11. Video quality in web browser is unacceptable. A function to disable the ""Your microphone is muted"" pop up would be nice.",1
This is very good app for ironing clothes. you can iron your clothes anywhere from your mobile . I iron my cloths from my mobile simply I run this app . After few minutes my mobile will get hot then I start ironing on my cloths . This app is asking to Bluetooth on before using this app. Battery is go down in 59 minutes meeting . I can't attend more than one hour meeting.,0

"Quality is not as good as competitors and also the UI isn't as good. I think Google Meet, Google Hangouts, Google Duo and Microsoft Teams are all better",1
"There are technical glitches pretty often, so I think the Microsoft guys should look into them. Otherwise its a great app.",1
Good,2
App from the the early 2000,0
But there's no option to change or hide background during meeting. Is it available only for apple brand?,1
"Awesome app, but u need to amplify the audio output. Output sound is low",2
We can't see the videos of all the participants. No navigation facilities between the videos of participants. No option to pin a particular participant's video.,2
"I use android and i cant seem to find virtual background on my setting. Thus, I cant add background.",0
I couldn't help myself get through with audio...kept on logging in n out...didn't work,0

Uses a lot of data in meeting,1
This app is best auido is best camera is also best👍👍👍👍👍,2
Great app was working fine until recently no one in work will get notifications until hours later sometimes even a day or two later. Most people miss a lot of important details we need for the day.,2
Sounds and visuals were very clear also this platform is amazing I use a few others and this one gave no problems.,2
"I cant open the file in the assignment . Well, i delete the app and then i reinstall it but still cant open . I can download the file in my other device by using the same wifi ,team account. I also cleared cache(hoping it will help somehow but no...). When i click on the file , nothing happen. Cant open cant download. It doesnt even have a downloading sign(;_;). I can download files in either General or Files but not in the assignment.",1
I am not always able to join with audio. I do not have this problem with other meeting tools. This is the only one not working properly. This is true for many other people in the organisation I work with.,0
"Go to meeting is a great way to commuicate with friends and collegues. I especially like tbe idea each participant can control if and or when they are to be seen or heard. You can choose to be there present, representing, apart but as you feel comfortable.",2
Does this app really work?,0
Super app for my school meeting's and am very happy this app is helping other childerns also in this corona period so thank you I love this app so much and once more thank you 😍🙂🙂,2

I want my facebook work to day please,0
There are few bugs That can be improved,2
"It's a very good app for online meeting and best choice for our online classes but it has some problems ,some time it's always write on screen connecting only,and we have proper network also that time.",1
Whenever I use the meet in my mobile or tab I doesn't get virtual background option but when I open the meet in my another mobile device I get virtual background option why so. Please see to it.,1
"Voice unclear,video keep on halting",0
"Everytime I try to join using the meeting link, it shuts off. Worst app I have ever used. I have to uninstall it 10 times and install it again before I can join the session.",0
It's great,2
Good app,2

Very good,2

User interface is very irritating to use. The entire page refreshes every time one opens any page and takes time to load despite fast internet. Browsing files/ images experience is bad as you cannot swipe to change and once you go back it refreshes. You cannot even sort by anything to make finding files easier. Nor does it provide any preview.,1
Haven't been able to hardly use the program. Opened it for visits with doctors. No zoom visits yet .Do I undo it or just wait.,0

The presenter had all the control in this software. As a participant I can't remove video or mute myself. It also doesn't allow a panoramic view on my cell phone.,0
"All good but 1. status (available,busy,presenting) is correctly updated in Desktop but not in mobile app. 2. Sometimes mobile team not receiving call ,but received correctly in Desktop",1

"Was great; but, there must have been an update and now the camera keeps fading in and out. I looked like i was in a thick fog - only emerging from it every once in a while",0
"Would be excellent, if sound was better; in some situations, audio reception is dismal. Customer service has yet to respond to my inquiry, of 2 months ago. Several updates did not result in a correction.",1
"Dark mode is broken. The items in the notification list show up on dazzling white. At the same time some buttons are so dark I can barely see them. I got an email informing me of a new notification, but when I opened the app it wasn't there. I needed to manually refresh the list to get it to appear.",0
"After last update, application crashes randomly anytime and exits meeting automatically. If I am an organizer, I need to make someone else organizer or else everyone will get exited from meeting. Bad impression to client calls and meetings.",0
A little bit of scattered noise on call. Other than that it went great. My very first time on a call like this. It was very easy to understand and get set up. Thank you,2
Good app,2
Unstable,0
"Sometimes I cannot incense the size to see smaller presentations. Other than that , a great app.",2
"Gmeet is a wonderful app, BUT I suggest making an update in this setting where on enabling the audio only feature in recieve resolution, the presentation will be visible and all the incoming video of participants will be disabled. Or Give a choice to the users in the setting of audio only of recieve resolution whether the users want to enable/disable receiving presentations.",0
Google meet on mobile is so very limited in terms of actual practical features like changing the layout to view more people in one screen and even the screen share feature does not offer audio support.,1

"Grainy, blocky, comes across standard definition yet we live in a high definition world. I've tried using via laptop and my gaming computer to no avail (internet connection is 300 Mb/s). Works solid on a phone though. I would prefer my son to be able to utilize a larger screen in efforts to aide learning. When the quality of connection is poor and I'm trying to get my 4 year old to pay attention, listen, becomes an unnecessary challenge.",0
I was able to use picture in picture feature for some day but yesterday and today I can't use it it gets disappear from home screen after touching it,1

"All I got was my initials, others' videos, and a message saying I was admitted to the meeting. After half an hour there was audio - which was totally unintelligible .. when it didn't go dead! Waited 'til 5:15 for audio to come back - then gave up. Waste of 45 minutes from my point of view! 22 Dec 2021 Today's meeting, ESG : Prof Hopkins: Reception, audio & visual, was excellent! Thanks very much.",0
Its good but connecting to Bluetooth headset are not working So please correct that issue,1
Worst app for video conferencing 😒,0

Great wway to trvel the wold from home.,2
"Easy to use, can see as well as send messages and view calender of mtgs so I can join mtgs in timely manner.",2
This was a great app until a recent update broke something associated with login. The app will get stuck by trying to display what might be a login screen. It's hard to tell because it flashes between the app page and login screen rapidly. Completely unusable in this state. Update - login issues were fixed. App works well for chat and calls.,2
Best video conference service out there so clear even with 50 or more different callers all at once and a moderator.,2
I like it but am not able to use the background changer.,0

It was very nicely presented and very helpful for Indain context.,2
Very good experience with Google meet app.,2
Not very easy using Android,0
I love the concept of this program and app BUT when colleagues complain about connectivity issues and frequently drop out of calls it tales the professional edge away from the product.   I am however a loyalist and will stick with it is long as I see progress.,1
Its ok,1
New bugs ! -Voice is brake sometimes even you have grate network. - Some times if me off mic is stop responding and not off. - join with code if you 1 min late and you write correct code you unavailable to join meeting. Fix these bugs as soon as possible .,0
It's ok. But it's not worth as zoom or Google meet bcoz was unable to pin the host. There was no option to pin the host and hence was unable to see screen share,2
Typing from my android but the text covered by keypad. So frustrating. Hope there'll an update to fix it.,1
"This app is best for online meeting but I face some problems on it like low sound,screen sharing problem,etc so please resolve it and thanks for this app",2
It's fast and clear👍👍🙏,1
I cannot login with my company account on Android app.Web version is fine .pls help me,0

Great app but it needs a very strong interest to run smoothly,2
It was a good experience but i had faced a little problem that i am not be able to see the everyone's video,2
No chats history. Even no people in the list with whom you had a chat. No cross device messages synchronization - how is it possible in 2021?,0
Good,2
This is a great app! But if we could put in our own backgrounds then it would be very helpful for everyone . The updates made this app more better BUT for some reason this APP IS NOT UPDATING ON MY MOTHER'S PHONE ! So please fix this many of my freinds are mobile users and are facing the same problems .,2
Why is the installation so big?,0

"Overall good experience, but user interface is a little confusing.",2
"When I have to turn back the screen during meeting or a class, sometimes it turns blank and I am not able to see any other apps, only able to see the notifications when I swipe down than I have to leave the class or meeting and rejoin. So, please fix my problem, so that it doesn't happen again.",1
"After the latest update, uploaded files in assignments are not opening at all from students view and login",1
It's very good and complecated,1
"I wish I could go 3.5. I've used this tool many times and on each call the are a few people who aren't able to get on the call for a while. In communication apps, small changes can be difficult, especially for many disabled people. I like GoToMeeting but there are now many other options. They used to be my 1st thought. Now, I may think of them 1st once in a while.",2
Can't log in in my phone. It was a waste,0
It's a good app and I like it but when I share the screen it is sometimes hang or my class disconnect. So that's why I don't like this app much. As I tell it gets hang or my class get disconnect. That is the reason behind I don't like this app much that's why I am giving only 3 stars,1
Is backgrounds feature is for tablets also 🤔 👀??,1
I like this app but sometimes i left my school classes it happens by its own fix this thing to,1
It's not as good as I expected and if you device is old it will have a lot of issues,1

Don't know why the developers developed this bogus meeting app. Go for normal Meeting app. It will take lots of internet data while previewing. And it will consume minimum 150MB in your android memory space. Go for other apps.,0
"It is a nice app to get things organized but it always keeps saying in the middle of my online classes that Microsoft teams stopped responding. It sometimes starts installing the app again, it only happens with this app. Sometimes, it gets so many glitches and takes hours to recover. It is a extremely slow app. Always stops responding. In my online exam I couldn't submit easily on not always on time. my father and I've to get into it and keep trying. mostly homework takes years to load.",0
Great meeting. Video & Audio clear. Easy to use.,2
I am not at all getting notifications...too bad an app,0
I have had several glitches and the app works really slow sometimes and it's really frustrating if I'm in a hurry.,1
Achcha hai,1
Its clear and dependable,2

It is a very good app but one problem which reduced 2 stars is that it automatically logs me out and when I login again after typing password there is a screen which comes hold on while we get things ready for you and then it just keeps rotating and rotating and then I have to uninstall it and then install it again so plzzz fix this,1
Used it with my doctor and my case manager for a group tele-health session and worked really well.,2

"Very good app. It's almost like Zoom app but it has its own limitations and advantages. Overall, it's a must recommended app for teachers, if they want to teach effeciantly.",2
One of the best conferencing tools,2
I'm not able to join my class after update it's showing that first update or join in other devices,1
Awesome!!!!!!,2
Bad experience,1
Can't log in most of the time,0
You can't leave the groups and it never send notifications of anything so you have to constantly check the app. Unfortunately I have to use this for school so they can give any work for days the teachers are unable to attend. It's a shame my college can't find a better app.,0
"The app is getting stucked.I am not able to open other app when the meet is on, even if the messages are important. Please fix the problem.",0

"Awesome app. Keeps me up-to-date with meetings, chats, and calls. Once you download the app, you can only use it for one Outlook account, wish I could use it for personal and business.. GREAT APP though..",2
This is one of the most important appd ever but please the storage stace it takes. Please make a Go Edition of this app to make this app run in Android Go Edition devices faster and take up less space.,1
Don't see to our problems,0
Worked well. I was able to connect with friends who practicing social distancing during tbe pamdemic.,2
"Great app it's good for video calls the call quality is super good like when your in a call and your lagging the audio catches up so you don't miss a word that the person your talking to. But there should be a blur background or change background when your in a meeting with your school, like for example your room is a mess and you don't want them to see it there should be an option for changing background. I hope this suggestion can help everyone and the app. Thank you.",1
"i find the app very easy to use, and it has a very clear voice reception. it lets me connect with lots of people around the world at a go. will gladly recommend it to my friends.",2

"Works perfectly. Use it everyday. Update: My chats all disappeared. I don't have access to them anymore and I don't know why. I've turned phone off and on, logged in and out, and now I'm going to uninstall and reinstall. I'm on a Google Pixel 4a cell. So uninstalling and reinstalling worked, but I'm going to leave it at a 4 because I shouldn't have had to do that. Otherwise, works great.",2

Good clarity of voice and video as well,2
"A little confusing at first, didn't automatically ask for all necessary permissions making it impossible to use all the features audio being one of them so we were kind of just staring at each other (which was really awkward lol) However once I checked app settings and realize that was the issue everything went smoothly and there was really great video audio quality surprisingly to hear, not laggy.... Overall devs did a great job!",2

Another half baked poorly designed Microsoft product. Any and all of the functionality of this application is removed for the mobile version.,0
The first version of Cisco webex was much better. It consumes a lot of data than before. The screen goes black. I have been facing really intolerable problems in webex. The WebEx stops responding when meetings are in progress. It lags too much. The audio quality is sooo poor. I didn't had these problem like now before. This has become the worst meeting app. Idk why it stops and hangs when a meeting is in progress. The voice of the host stops. Please fix this.,0
Very easy setup I had children's court and I was able to set up everything quickly without hassle and EASE thank you kindly,2
Does great when you first download it onto your phone but sometimes glitches and slows down. But I've had in a time where it ended up not allowing me to attend meetings for some reason even though I reset my phone I deleted the app and reloaded the app and still couldn't access it only reason why I can use it now is because I bought a new phone. But as long as it continues to work I have t o use it and it seems to be doing a decent job.,1
Works great at replicating the Teams experience on my Android phone. Not sure what else I would want to do other than that but so far so good!,2
Audio from interviewer was really bad. Not sure if it was his connection.,1
It's nice but need an improvement that it should not get exited when we attend a call,2
I will only give 2 stars Bcz.. Before it was working very well.. But now very poor.. I don't know why... My Internet speed is very good... Again nd again it is connecting.. If it is connecting then audio is not coming..My classes are going pending.. Bcz of this problem I missed my classes.. Plz check it.. I had uninstall it nd again install it.. But still no change.. Fed up..,0
good consistant service and easy to understand interface,2
"Difficulty logging in to meeting, video kept going out on phone but Webex would not allow me to connect from my laptop. Worst platform experience EVER.",0

Couldn't hear any audio in showing video presentation using mobile..😥😢,1
"Video was very ok. Audio was clear tho ,but lot of network hitches",1

"In viva insights, I finished my virtual commute and it said enjoy the rest of the day. But it is giving notification everyday it said that ready to wrap up again o should do the virtual commute",0
"The questions that they ask you are confusing. I'm not sure whether it was my phone or the software, but the picture was lousy. It asked if I wanted audio, I told it yes, thinking I would not need my ear buds. I'm glad I had them in my purse.",1
Nice aap,2

"Joom is as a very apropriate application for online meeting which is used a lot of people but there are anly one thing which is not acceptable ant comfertable for any user that is ,when we start any meetting then a permission pop up that is for the audio permission after that permission the mike is allready started or unmuted whenever it shulde be muted.",2
Nice app....but sometimes it creates a problem of disconnecting many tyms....or camera function....or audio.....but it is gud for our school online classes...I like the app....,1
We experience good quality,2
We use Teams all the time both in and out of the office. It has become an essential tool for communication.,2
it should have the option for all the organizers to restrain the permission for the attendees in all the meetings which is organised by any other organizer.,2
Good but we can /ttt downlouud iinn tv,2
"The video call was fairly good, it became a little choppy about halfway into the 10 minute call. Overall, I would have to say that it was pretty good when compared to having video calls on other comparable services in the past.",2
In tril versions Audio on Phone called posible but in this versions Phone in call audio not worked. We have to connected with Internet Audio functions. During the meeting Normal Audio Call can effect or so many time Disconnect from meeting.,0
"Meetings are all good with so much options available. But everytime I update it it shows ""You're all done. Hang on, while we get things ready for you "" And then I hang ,not the time, but the app. I have to delete and reinstall it to get it right.Please fix this issue as it is such a wastage of time and resources. Overall, in terms of everything, I have found it to be quite good, since I have been using it for 2 years.I sincerely hope for this issue to be fixed.",1
Having issues with the app. It's not permitting me to do my job well and it couldn't connect well to my phone or computer. Webex please look into or see how this program can work similar to the other video platforms. I had a VERY challenging time using this program for both mobile and desktop (Windows 10).,0
This app is very good for children,2
"When I tried to join a meeting for the first time, I couldn't hear anything or day anything. I had to close the app and job the meeting again for it to work.",1
It is not very good after some times it says report problem and I have to switch of my video so that I can listen clearly and there is no option to remove profilr like youtube but the quality is good,1
This app desperately needs an option to let you NOT be on speaker so you can use it like a normal phone and not fill your office with noise.,1
May21 2019 : works awesome on Android 9. no support for lower Android versions. Sep10: Still unable to login via app. Not sure if it is my android 4.4.4 or what. July 16th: Wonderful app stopped working + unable to login after latest update on Android. :-'(,2
Quite good. Some times Audio disturbances are there. Regards.,2
Unless I am mistaken all attendees need to be in the synched address book. Often I need to invite people who are not in my address book but there seems to be no way to invite people on the fly. Please post a correction if I am mistaken.,1
The integration of the mobile and desktop application seems to be smoother and better in Sync which is the feature that stands out..,2
Good but we need (lite) version. It would be better with lite version,2
The information that was given in a short period of time was absolutely valuable ! Links were provided for those like me who were at work listening. Thanks so much,2

Nice app😊😊💖💖,2
"I have been using meet sice the end of 2019 and i must say that i was very satisfied with its features and all. But during somewhat around november or october google released a totally different meet and i didn't like that at all. Updates are supposed to make the app easier to use but this new version made it more complicated to use, for example to open messages i need to open messages the previous meet was simply just a swipe. I'd really appreciate if google brought the previous meet back if not could google meet at least be made a bit less complicated.",0

While connecting with Bluetooth speaker voice not connected,0
"The connection depends very heavily on your internet unlike other video conferencing apps such as ms teams. And the frame rate of the video and screen share is very bad and slow . And the worst thing is that this app has some very shady stuff. When you close the app it doesn't show in the recents tab which means its constantly running in the background , and the same on windows it doesnt stop on clicking the cross button , until and unless you manually press quit zoom.",0
You've conducted one survey of user feedback in a long time and it only asks the questions that can't collect the flaws. Q 1: Was GoToMeeting easy to use today? Q 2: What do you like about GoToMeeting? Let me tell you what I DON'T like about GoToMeeting. I DON'T like the frequent cutting of voice. Why do you only ask what I like; why not what i don't. I also DON'T like the inability to mute someone if that person is being annoying.,0
"Its alright, it can be very laggy at some points and the audio is kinda bad. But other than that everything else if fine",1
usefull app,0
I didn't understand how it is working kindly guide me please thank you,1
Good,1
I love how each can post is on an individual thread. That way conversations don't get all intertwined. The thing I find completely frustrating is that you can't search anything or anyone on the threads in Teams. Sometimes I can't find something someone said. I want a search feature like OneNote or One Drive has. It is a serious omission!!!,1
Best app for attending lecture as well as we can communicate with other on her personal number but during exam it's doesn't get any option for suring your submission,0
"When I am in a call and go to another app or lock the screen on my phone, it starts reconnecting until I open the call window again. I hope you fix this because its disgusting",0
Disappointed-keeps cutting out & too much reverb & screen freezing up,0
I only use this b/c my doc uses it for meetings. Clunky controls and really spotty connectivity. Google Meet is so much better.,0
After the update zoom app takes time to connect.Now it is taking 5 minutes to connect my online class.Do something!I am very disappointed. Burn Hall Higher Secondary school Sonwar Srinagar Gupkar Road Class:7th Section:B Roll no.30,0

This app will help you dream BIG!,2
I love this app. Very professional!,2
"I've never used another tool which is so thoroughly effective AND enjoyable. From the ease of setup to the rock-solid user experience, there's no way I will ever go back to another conference call till if I can help it!",2
It automatically closes after a few seconds once i joins a meeting. I need to reinstall the app to avoid this problem. After every meeting the same thing is repeated. Please fix this bug problem.,0
I don't like that the meet ask us how was meeting so . Meet company have to do something abuot it,1
"When I join a meeting it defaults to speaker ""On"" which is fine, but only a barely audible gargling sound comes out. I have to quick switch the speaker off and then I can hear the meeting. But not being able to use the speaker on my phone is really annoying. I'm using an S7.",1
"If the class stretches for more than 30 mins I won't be audible to anyone regardless of the mic being green. I HAVE to relog for the mic to work again. And before you tell me I have to ""connect the mic"" or ""change the audio options"" lemme tell you that it's on phone. Mic is inbuilt. And I'm not the only one having this issue on android. Fix it or keep your one star :l Other thing that you may point at but I refute...my network is fine. It's home wifi. 300mbps is MORE than sufficient :l",0
Ok,2
"My audio went in and out, so the person could barely hear me. Not good for an informal interview! The video was clear though. Please improve the program's ability to read a mic.",0

Teams is very useless app because I attend class on team and they show 12 o clock class but the class was he'd on 11'o clock,0
horrific. meetings drop for no reason. massive problems with version control. navigating the file directories is a complete mess. no support whatsoever.,0
"Its a nice app, but it takes unnesesarry data so the class is sometimes disconnected. Its has many feature for the host can share the screen, whiteboard,documents ,photos etc. Overall its an nice app",1
"Developing more features in iOS instead of Android...bad form...example: camera views and the ability to see everyone in the meeting. Will have organization meet in MS teams until this would would be corrected. Word to developer: feels like you might be an Apple first, but you can't forget about Android which actually has more users in the world. Whenever I see this I steer my organization away from software that's designed more for Apple towards less biased platforms.",0
"This app is nice but this app has only one problem that there is no option to use backgrounds in android 8.1.0 , it is available in android 9.0 and above",2

"Very informative, easy to follow, friendly and pleasant counselor/instructor. Would recommend to anyone needing help managing their blood pressure. Thank you so much Stacey!!!",2
"Web ex continually changes the format and locations of the user interfaces. Very frustrating. A customer wants to smoothly get in to the software and get smoothly through a meeting without having to spend the first 5 minutes of every set up trying to figure out what changes Web ex has made. Adding insult to injury, the format changes are nearly inconsequential to the function other then the hide-and-seek fumbling around the user has to suffer to discover the new process.",0
"Zoom uses data and doesn't inform you or let you turn that off. The more I'm forced to use this app, the more I discover things I hate about it. This is well into the 21st century. This stage of failure because of poor user options should be done by now.",0
My second experience with Cisco WebEx has been much better than the first time I communicated using the app.,2

"Google Meet is going to be like the Betamax in the Video wars of yesteryear. Google Meet used to be very attractive to people seeking alternatives to Zoom, with its 24 hour time limit for meetings. No more, Google has surrendered its far superior product by choking the time limit to 60 minutes. 60 minutes on Google Meet versus 40 minutes on Zoom. With Zoom already having a monster footprint in the virtual meeting world, this is perfect to shoot yourself in the foot, Google! Hello, wake up!!",0

"Teams is a great concept, but the Android App and Windows App are both unusable. Frequently get disconnected for no apparent reason, to the point where restarting the device doesn't even fix the issue. The mobile app just randomly will not show you messages.

If yes then it would be great.",2
Good video meeting app But some drawbacks 1 admit all option 2 chat to individual,2

First i am giving it 2 star because we can take classes using this application. Second The time to open this app is very much it takes minimum 2 minutes to open. Third they have removed the option to refresh the mettings and the lag is tooo much after update they don't fix any bug or add any features only they add some more lag that's why I am giving it 2 stars.,0

My company uses this app for meetings and other remote sessions. It works well for most things. A simple meeting face to face or over the phone with many in the company this does very well.

need to improve more and more as of now looks fine,1

My experience with this app is positive with the exception of how easy it is to connect. Connection requires steps to have a good memory. If you are slow there is not enough time to enter information.,1

"It was okay until the update happened. It getting worser and worser. Its not even my laptop problem.its really annoying when i want to have a discussion for any projects even with good internet connection, for some reason suddenly got kicked out from the meeting or sometimes it said 'bad connection problem'. Like my Internet clearly is in its strong status but i got kicked from the meeting like 4 to 5 times in a day.",0

This has been a nightmare since I initially installed and try to have a telemed conference. It won't open on my phone it will not load on my phone. I finally was able to get it loaded on my computer on Firefox. I was unable to find anything that showed me how the heck I turn on volume and Camera. So the entire appointment was wasted trying to get this thing to run. I have spent spent hours on Firefox Chrome Microsoft Edge and my phone trying to get this to run properly. Do not waste your time.,0
Its so hackable by the gov. Or docs. And any hacker can use it as a backdoor to all your devices. And once installed hard to completly clean out . It just reinstalls when you sleep.,1

Mostly good. Only some sound interference and got disconnected once or twice.,2
App is excellent but can you allow mobile and tab users to change background,2

Mobile users can't use or the audience can't here the audio when the host is using a mobile device. Also please put a seen notice on the chats if thats possible?😅 Thanks 👍,1

It is difficult to caught the students from cheating...... So please get this kind of updates. And the worst thing is that we cannot detect that who muted us or removed us from the meeting.",1

It won't give me an option for virtual background on my Google pixel 6. Very disappointing.,0

Reduced sound to make it hard to hear. Drained battery. Lots of feedback. Uses a lot of bandwidth. Video cut off on it's own.,0

I think I actually like the mobile app better than the one for Windows. Now it's 2 years later and the improvements to the desktop app have made it the better of the two. It's probably the best messaging app on the internet today.,2
The app is working well and every thing is good but there's a small proplem which is when i connect my device whith a head phone by blue tooth it keeps lagging although my internet speed is 30 mps I don't know if it's aproplem from my device or it's a proplem with the app please and thanks.,2

Excellent app I liked this all because I can study in this app,2
First i am giving it 2 star because we can take classes using this application. Second The time to open this app is very much it takes minimum 2 minutes to open. Third they have removed the option to refresh the mettings and the lag is tooo much after update they don't fix any bug or add any features only they add some more lag that's why I am giving it 2 stars.,0
"Because of the situation of unstable connection or suddenly got interrupted there's a tendency that it will look like someone's intentionally left. I humbly suggest to make a status for those accounts that their internet reception is not good or taking a long time to load. So that, before being disconnected and automatically leave a meeting, the instructor will know their situation and it will look less rude leaving a meeting due to internet connection issues. Hoping for kind consideration.",2
My experience has been great. The App allows me to connect while out of the office and without a computer connection.,2

"After the recent update, performance is mediocre at best and the 'breakout rooms' feature doesn't appear to work, with a black unending loading screen appearing whenever a user joins a breakout room. This results in the user being stuck in the breakout room, even if the host forces them to close. The only way to leave a meeting when this happens is to close the app itself using the taskbar on my device. Until this issue is fixed, I can't rate more than 3 stars really.",1

"Google meet is very nice app but i had given 3 stars because it doesn't have any type of options to record the meeting with sound. Even though if we use another third party app to record meeting with voice so there is a big big ""NO"" you can record only the screen of the meeting but cannot save the recording with audio which a very dissapointing thing. I suggest to add-on this option so that users can easily record any meeting with audio without any problem and without any third party app.",1

"Terribly poor setup. [edit]...I don't want to do your job for you. Just bring someone in off the street. Tell them to set it up and test it on their phone. You will get your answers....Also, first time I used it, I had important meeting. I turn on my camera and my own video overlayed on video from other party. I hit every button I could find and still could not pull my video off theirs. I never could pull my video away so had to turn off my camera so only I could see other party. It was not two-way. Terrible. [edit again] You don't understand my issue. My video overlays 90% on top of other person in meeting. So I see myself but not them. The only way to see them is if I turn off my camera. Then obviously he can't see me, but I can see him. Frustrating because it was important meeting and this glitch was ill-timed. It should be easier to test before an important meeting starts.",0
Good!,2
I like this app but there is some issues that you need to work on 😜,1
"Awesome way to b apart of a meeting, without leaving home. I recently did a update and the host couldn't share their screen. Every one in the meeting experienced audio issues.

Crashes everytime when I open one specific chat.,0
Does not sync with my calendar for existing conference calls. No go for me. App looks slick otherwise.,0
This app is totally waste I am a student every day I miss one class it is showing connecting,0
Not very satisfying!,1
"#There are bad features in new uptade.

Loved this app easy to use,2
"Sometimes it is getting struck with audio, but for audio problem it is very good",2
"Completely unusable mobile experience. Every 2 seconds the audio cuts out for about 1 second. This results in not being able to get anything anyone is saying, & basically cannot use for mobile. Updating to add this issue has been ongoing for months across multiple mobile devices for multiple users. A general Google search find MANY experiencing this. Stable internet, on & off VPN's, different internet connections, different routers, on & off wifi, but the problem persists.",0
Good,2
The application is alright.,2
"It freezes during the meeting. A little bit difficult to move around while the meeting is taking place,",2

The Pastor was clear speaking but the lighting was poor in the room where it was recorded.,1
It's a great app for having meetings and conferences remotely. Easy to use. I like the variety of ways to sign into the app. Also you can choose to use the video or not to use the video. The meetings can be recorded if you want that done. You or another person can be the host for the meeting. There are some more features of this app that is good to have.,2
"Dependable and fast. No issues over Wi-Fi, tho some breaking up over 4G. That could be due to the carrier though, I'm not sure. Enjoy the intuitive and easy to use interface!",2

App is working properly but calls doesn't ring I just see missed calls. The only solution I found is to uninstall and re-install the app to make it work for a while,1
Great app and concept however the sound is no longer working properly on iPad 8th generation. I've tried to address this multiple times with them but their customer service is appalling. No help whatsoever and their bot is useless. Works fine on other devices (such as this Galaxy) but very frustrating that it is inconsistent on others. Multiple reviews have mentioned this yet they are not addressing it. Kind of hard to communicate without any sound.,0
"It's amazing for my online school, although it's laggy sometimes and as well kicking me out of the call, even though my wifi was full on bar's, but it's amazing, For my online school of course.",2

"We used the free version of UberConference for our social group to meet. Many of our members are older than Generation X, so we needed a conferencing tool that was easy to use for our older members, and UberConference did not disappoint.

Since we needed to meet via this medium for at least one more month, we did upgrade to the paid version. For social groups, can't go wrong!",2

With Zoom I get to take my turn at watching over her every day for an hour or two while I talk to her & read the Bible to her. I am several states away & this app is wonderful to let me see my daughter very clear on tablet & allow me to talk to her because I know she hears me & can hear her mom tell her I love her. Thanks 4 Zoom app!,2
I had my first business meeting today. I could not hear voice 😭.,1
"Before it was just fine,I could still use background,filter until recently there was a problem which i could not use the background nor the filter. I tried everything,I tried upgrading,Uninstalling but when i Uninstalled and downloaded it back,The button for filter/background is NOT there.And im really sad that i couldn't use filter because im INSECURE of my looks and the filter has always helped me cover my face.But not i couldn't do anything.Please fix it",1
Joining the meeting was a night mare could be there was a technical problem nonetheless it was very clear,1
I like the new version of meet but I need my google meet and gmail separated because when I close Google meet automatically gmail got open please separate both of them,1
Everything was easy to use and I would like to suggest it to all.,2
the app good but why I can't put background on android (vivo y91) @@,1
The application is completely unusable under Android 10. After 30 seconds the whole interface disappears,0
Dont know yet it refused downloading,0
"Gritty, kept losing signal",0
Good,2
It's an interesting app I love it and it's easy to work with,2
Kyu banaya aisa app 😭😭😭 Humari Khushi bardash nhi Hui kyaa🥺🥺🥺,0
Worst app I ever seen in my whole life,0
A good tool for this learning experience. I make it a practice to never give five stars. It is sufficient that this app works for me.,2

"One of the best app for remote meetings . Needs bit improvement with screening sharing(the screen lags and takes time to update, even if there is good network bandwidth) .",2
Great,2
No seriously. Replace your local copy of the Constitution with this (it's written better anyways).,2
Good,2
Good app,2
What a wow... So ever helpful🙏🏾😇,2
Did mot see how to chat in the chat box,1
Awesome app to chat and attend meetings over phone. I can even see screen sharing reasonably well. But doesn't sync with desktop app even after signing out or reinstalling.,2
This app was too good for studying 👍,2
Good for meetings especially for teaching but need to be made more user-friendly like other apps of similar working,1
Connection issues and did now swich over to head set,0
"The app is very good, I am very impressed with how it let's you join so many people, I can do all of my classes and join work all the time. I am waiting for it to update so I hope it does not act up.",2
It's a good app we use this for our class my problem is the change background is not showing..... And when i present on my PHONE it doesn't make sound like its my only device i dont have a computer... and when i full screen my teachers presentation my face will show on the other side i wish you can remove it cause sometimes there something important there but my freaking face showing there pls.... Make this app even better,1

Background is not changing in Redmi 8A Dual. How will I change the background of my Redmi 8A Dual? 𝐀𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝟑.𝟒 𝐬𝐢𝐳𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐚. 𝐖𝐞 𝐰𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝟏𝟔. 𝟗 𝐇𝐃 𝐯𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐨.,1
Very bad,0
It's OK,1
Greatly,2
I will give it five stars cause these app is really good.best among the good ones,2
It kept breaking up both video and audio.,1
"This is very useful app for online class and meetings but 1 thing that i gave this 3 stars is in online class we can only see 5,6 students faces, we have to talk or pin in the top to see and hear voices of students and sometime sir and miss call us or ask questions, we tell the answers but they didnt hear what we aretalking and we cannot see all faces in this meeting we have to pin or come in the top to say who didnt hear us in that way we have to pin turn by turn please improve it and do update",1
Normal users cannot create account or cannot organised meeting in this diet a disappointing point of this application otherwise everything is nice,2
Becuase it was by wifi,2
Terrible to use,0
"Thats bad meet app because the camera is delay, sometime is unvoice",0
Hh,2
"This latest version is terrible. The sound quality is decent. But there's no way to switch the device audio anymore to say your Bluetooth headset, or your speakerphone, the option has completely disappeared",0
Super,2
"It worked well except a few seconds of distorted sound. I think it happened a few times throught 2 hrs class. And, I assume it's something to do with network.. It happened when someone among participants had trouble with connecting. Except that, it was excellent! I wish I can give 4.5 stars.",2
In terms of mobile meetings I like this WebEx the best. The recent update that overhauled the program is why I prefer WebEx over other mobile meeting programs.,2
Now it is useful and good app,2
"Many times I cannot keep a clear, uninterrupted, video playing. I have to leave the meeting and rejoin. Then it seems to get better. Otherwise, great app for connecting!",2
I only give this 3 stars cause it wont let me put a background and it's kinda annoying..please let everyone put backgrounds,1
Helpful App,1
Data saver option should be added because it consumes very much data.,1
Good... Clear voice and sound Very nice tha apps,2
Dont wast a time,0

Its haven't effect 😕,2
It is slow and takes time to change from activity to calendar. It takes time to open files and go to different channels. Not just that but it takes time to open and stops working regularly. Worst mam app,0
2 stars is low Beaz of camera is not working and I was updating app but doesn't have back ground change on camera and was good but need those two Thank you......,1
Good,2
"This app doesn't respect my settings. I have REPEATEDLY turned off notifications, only to have my preferences overridden several hours later. I work in a large institution and get notifications incessantly, many of which are irrelevant to me. It is highly stressful to have to keep dealing with this. If this is not fixed, I will have to delete this app.",0
"I am looking forward for this app that will have a CHANGE BACKGROUND on Android user, Especially for those students who have online classes . Thank you. Godbless",2
Me and my friend want to call and a annoying thing pops up so now I'm stuck with not calling her😭😭,1
Eggn,0
"Chat, groups and being able to join meetings on the go works great. But it is ridiculous that you cannot stop calls and meeting requests from ringing on the phone. I hid the notification which made it worse, now it just rings with no way to answer or reject. Until you can turn off calls, this will continue to cause more harm than worth.",0
"The app runs pretty well, but controls feel like they were borrowed from Windows 95 - they're a bit awkward and clunky at times. Also, I had to disable and re-enable bluetooth twice during a meeting to get audio back to my earbuds after sound would suddenly cut out",1
Shadrix niyonizera,1
Very good platform indeed,2
Really good app but I don't have any camera background options this forces me to use the zoom please enable the camera backgrounds on phones,1
Good,2
"It's a very good app for online meeting but it doesn't have white board system. So please try to implement this feature, because teachers need to explain us something through their screen share.Sometimes the video quality become so blur pay attention in these things.",1
Good one,2
I wonder how sensitive material will be handled by FB? I can see FB trading against companies based on algorithms spying on company posts. Another useless I.T initiative.,0

Good aap for study but it have many technical problems,1
"It works, but it has some major bugs and annoyances. Since the last update, I can't start my video in landscape orientation; the button to start falls off screen. My button to leave a meeting gets hidden behind the 'person x left the meeting' notification. Audio sometimes starts in speaker mode while I have a bluetooth headset connected. When I switch Audio device or when I get a phone call and reject it, audio volume gets halved and very low quality, restarting the app is the only fix.",1

Super,2
The App Has Very Network Issue and we cannot see other's Screen Properly. Even I Cannot Attend Proper Meeting.So I request you to Please Solve this Issue.,0
Works flawlessly just as good if not better than the Deaktop app. The only thing I dislike is that WebEx in order to stay competitive bought another app but then instead of merging the app's features with the existing WebEx app they decided to release two different versions. So now on every OS you have to download and Install two different versions of WebEx as depending on which version the host uses to setup a meeting a separate app gets launched when joining. Other than that so far so good.,2
It was great except the audio was crackles worse than my great grandpa's transitory radio!!!!!!!!!!,2
"I can't use Bluetooth headphones, and I've seen many people complain online about it as well. It's unbelievable that this app in 2021 can't even handle Bluetooth...",1
Can u make feature that enable the host to pin chat,2
"It was fun,nice and reallict",1
I use the mobile app a lot and the keyboard on android covers my chat box so I can't see what I'm typing. Outside of that the app works great.,2
The app itself is fine but it keeps draining my battery and my phone persists in telling me this. Not worth it if my phone is dead. Please fix.,0
I love it.it is very usefull app,2

Very bad experience with the app... During a school group call my child is not audible at all or the voice echoes.... Got the Samsung tab checked in multiple service stations it has no problem at all. And all the other app like zoom are working perfectly well. Sent a mail to the help desk too but there is not response or update for the same.,0
"I have no problem with this app except some network problems. The error codes are truly annoying especially error code 104 103. It disabled many of my classes. Another problem is the ENTER KEY!!! Whenever I want to ask my teacher a big doubt, and I click the enter key (in chat), it sends my message!!! Please solve them and probably my review will change. Thanks!!!",1
"Good, with audio notifications or speach to text option would be 5star",2
I'm able to multitask while in a meeting so that is amazing. App works in portrait or landscape too. VERY sophisticated app. As a QA professional with 15+ years experience I am very impressed.,2

"The app is fantastic... I love it. Only thing is to share with your team is that, when the organizer is speaking the tagline will always appear on the screen as: ""........ is speaking"" its annoying to the audience, especially in the vertical view of mobile. Either it could be disappered automatically after few seconds or there must be an option to close it by audience. Kindly work on this and sort it out soon. Thank you.",2

Nice app.,1
Since your 12/10 update the mobile app for Android will not work. It just spins and says we have installed an update and are getting things ready for you.,0

Easy to use but when I unplug my earphones speaker turns on so please off the speaker while unplugging earphones,2
Terrible. I shouldn't have to login to connect to a group that is established. I should be able to join a group without logging in their system. Two thumbs down,0
uber conference is excellent and everyone should use it.,2
Audio quality was awful. Lost 1/2 of the other person's conversation. Video was difficult to set up. Other party unable to cast Video at all. Very frustrating and negative experience.,0

"When I log in , the processer take a lot of time . And when I'm trying to report this complaint it won't open . Teams was good in the past , but now it has gone really downhill",0
Lot's of echoing and feedback makes listening intolerable. That's a user/organizer issue. But so what. When it happens it happens regardless of whose fault it is. Hopefully COVID will be on the way out soon so that in person meetings can resume.,1
I am using this app from 2 years for online classes there is no problem in last 2 years . But after the update of december 2021 i cant open any assingment . Hope this will fix,0

It's flexibility makes virtual meetings interesting and desirable.,2
I have been on 2 meetings to date. To days audio issues were a little bit worse because there were a lot of dropouts. It did appear that everyone I could see had their microphones muted so there should not have been that much extra noise coming from the attendees on the call.,1
"Good sound quality, nice features",2
My face book..was removed..Please renstate.thank you.,2
As others have noted this is purely a phone dialer app. You would have an easier time setting up speed dial. Not to mention the US long distance number it requires you to call.  Considering this is marketed as VoIP the feature set is sorely lacking and dated,0
Cisco Webex works really great like right now we're on lockdown cuz of the covid-19. It works really great to communicate with the teachers n getting school work done n have meeting with the teacher so I would like to say thank you very much for this app,2

This app was good..but I am facing some camera issue since few months My camera is so dark that my face is not at all clear.I hope that it can be fixed ASAP. Google Kindly look after it.,0
Excellent way to communicate throughout our organization and building. One thing that is missing is it didn't save a draft of a lengthy message I started.,2
You really should consider making a setting for the away time. The 3 to 5 minutes is way to short! We have this on thousands of company computers and everyone says the same thing. Their Teams show away and people end up not calling them because of it. Not everyone in tied to their computer all day. There are non-computer task too!,0
Very much for your support of the year old girl I don't know what you think about it was a good time with my family is a great day of the day with you guys,2
Waste this app is total waste because no voice can be heard even if we have good internet connection,0

Good,2
I updated my ms teams app in my phone. It disconnects when i join a team meeting for online classes even if my wifi connection is fast and stable. The reason for wanting an update is because there is no adding picture background feature furing calls on ms teams in my phone. I have missed my 3 classes already just trying to troubleshoot this. Just turn down the app. It doesn't help much ever since the update.Your new update wasn't helpful. Big regrets for updating it was good until it wasn't.,0
This app is good but I face some issues in-between,0
awesome😀,2
The mike is well done but something happened to the camera it became dark People on the call aren't able to see me,0
I am giving it 2 stars because one reason is it doesn't has the raise hand feature and another is the background changing feature. Some members of the meeting can change background but I can't.,0
"Only one person can talk at once, know this is not a bad thing itself, but needs to be like full duplex. You always stumble starting to speak because you're never quite sure if the other person had one more thing to say and if everyone else only hears you cut in, or the other person finish speaking, or both of you at same time. Basically seems like only one mic at a time can be active.",0

"Teams is a definite step forward from Skype for Business/Lync, but the mobile experience still has some rough edges.

"I use this for weekly meetings, and it's good. They just added background effects, and that's fun. I've just never used anything else, like Zoom, so I can't compare it. It's good for groups, if people are mindful of their own background noise. I don't have any interest in trying out any other brand, Google has me covered.",2

I have been using Lifesize from last 9 months and it's an Amazing experience for me. Best video quality and seamless and smooth experience. With single click I can join meetings in no second and have my scheduled calls on the go. Thank you Lifesize.,2

It doesn't open at all,0
"The app seems to work smoothly in general and I haven't had challenges with glitching or spontaneous shutting down. Having more participant videos visible than my screen is formatted for, however, means that I cannot see the other participants as there is no way to scroll through pages of participants. I also find it distracting that the screen flashes gray when jumping between active speakers in the active speaker mode. This is particularly a problem when we are having quick moving discussions.",2

I don't think much I just love it,2
"It's a nice app but sometimes presenting is not clear, video and audio quality is sometimes poor and sometimes it disconnects automatically the class. Fix this problem. I have a great network connection.",1
It's a little bit late while sharing the screen.,1
"It is good app for meeting,but there not `Apply virtual effects` option",2
Not nice as much i expect,1
Its a good app though but nowadays I'm facing some problems like one of the biggest problem is that when i join a meeting it takes my name and says connecting but it doesn't connect my Internet speed was above 3mbps but it didn't connect after waiting for a long time.I don't know it is a bug or what but please fix it.I can't do my online class,1
Very effective method of orienting new staff & facilitating meetings & interviews during a time when face to face time is reduced to help mitigate the spread of illness.,2
Hasn't had any problems and I've been using it for well over 2 years with groups consisting of over 100 people. Well worth downloading and 5 stars,2
Best meeting application on play store. 👍💯,2
User friendly,2
"Overall, my 'Webex' experience (being used only on my Galaxy Note 9) has been just slightly slacking, in the field of video image transmission. But what free wireless audio/video conference app doesn't struggle with that at least a little bit, right? Aside from that however, I don't really have any complaints or other issues. Easy to set up, easy to navigate, super easy to use user-friendly interface, great connection times. In all a very well rounded app. Recommended over other alike apps.",2
"Much more usable now with the new UI. Try not to ruin it again though Mr. Developers. Actually, I personally would like to see a button too change refresh rate of the videos. Even other platforms are capable of doing 30fps at least so why can't you?",1
Not able to open assignment file in assigned section without Microsoft Office Pervious version was not having such issue Improve this thing,0
It always has some problems. I face difficulty when sending assignments and when in the lobby. When I sendy assignment the work is shown but the turned in doesn't shows in my teachers side and the thing in the lobby is that whenever I am in the lobby it says we will let people know that you're in the lobby when the meeting starts but the fact is the meeting's already started like 20 or 30 minutes ago and the people other side couldn't see me. The app needs to be improved.,0
Couldn't leave meeting without having to relaunch app,1
The meeting was good but the presenter probably didn't recognize I logged into his meeting but then again he was busy so no biggie.,2
Very nice,1
After new update the application is taking lot of time in mobile as well as desktop,1

Zoom is great for my yoga class,2
"I should not have to crank my volume all the way to Max in my car and still can't hear people in the meeting. I am running on an Android LG Q7. I ran previously on another Android, and then on an Apple device before that. seems to work better on Apple.",0
"So far this is good, however I am limited in my use of it though. I have this also on my laptop but I would prefer to use this app, though 1 problem is that there is no option to use a USB camera. I am using this app through a Dex Station and there is no function to use an external webcam.",1
Ok,1
Was a little laggy in terms of video and audio,1
"Audio is a little better than last time. It could be the internet, but I haven't noticed it to this degree with other meeting apps.",2

"As an android user, I have extreme difficulty staying logged in on the aap. I've had to verify my account almost every day, it's very inconvenient. Not to mention, I'm having to deal with Apple users telling me it must be an 'android thing'. How embarrassing. This is not better than zoom.",0
Ok ok Not too good 😔,0
To use it,2
"All I got was my initials, others' videos, and a message saying I was admitted to the meeting. After half an hour there was audio - which was totally unintelligible .. when it didn't go dead! Waited 'til 5:15 for audio to come back - then gave up. Waste of 45 minutes from my point of view! 22 Dec 2021 Today's meeting, ESG : Prof Hopkins: Reception, audio & visual, was excellent! Thanks very much.",0
I can't hear without a Blur everytime some one speaks,0
It is very easy to take online classes on this app and it is very good app for students as well as teachers,2

This app is only useful for known users. Not for guests.,0
"Great functionality minus one problem. The ability to edit for Android users is there, however it will not allow the user to edit it. However, if you have an IPhone, no problems. Hopefully this is a bug that gets addressed and fixed quickly.",1
The app is good but I won't give the 5 stars because I want an improvement on the audio recording of it.,2
Awesome app,2
Bad Application processing is Not Good High Network Capacity required,1
Good app for keeping connected to the office. This is also its downside... it keeps you connected to the office!,2
Best team communication tool of all times. we use it on a large group and it helps you to maintain our team sharpe,2
cant host on phone or tablet.,1
I downloaded this and was using it within a few minutes at a softball game when I had forgotten a meeting. Easy to use.,2

"Audio issues, video issues and skipping issues across the board, for all users. First time using it, just downloaded it, and using it is contingent on letting it record audio. That is a very bad deal for a free ap that's not going on my new phone, when I get it next week.",0

But, everytime I try to login on my Visits with him, it takes me to other nonrevelivent sign in & up pages making me late for our 15 .minute short visit. Why❓. Otherwise, Thanks",0
Invasive. I don't like having to log in every time. I wish it wolf use the fingerprint pad to log in and it would be great if it would remember my username.,0
Very useful but also very buggy. Frequently crashes and frequently fails to send messages despite there being no connectivity problems.,1
Pretty good way to widen the geographic boundaries of the meeting space.,2
"Not sure If there was a recent update, but suddenly I cant do anything on the app. Anytime I try to type anything, the app reloads and erases what I've typed. The app has been great since I started using it, but over the past few days it's been absolute garbage. Hopefully they release a new update quickly.",0
This is a useful app for online classes. But sometimes network problem occurs.,1
Been ok but suddenly screen share is a problem. Pictures and videos disappear. Seems to have been after last update. Otherwise great.,2

"Worst app I've ever seen...don't even want to give 1 star. There was a lot of interruption in my first meeting- Audio issues, video issues and connectivity issues! Also, there was a beeping sound in between that the meeting became more horrible!!!!😡 In my point of view, zoom would be way more better than this app.",0
It is very important for me to do this application.,2
"This app is pretty unreliable and lacking in features compared to competing products. Switching from 4G to WiFi, or WiFi to 4G will cause it to crash. Switching from speaker to Bluetooth will cause it to crash. Receiving a regular call (even if dismissed) while using the app will cause the app to crash. App does not support background operation or PiP mode, so you cannot multi task with this app - attempting to do anything else will cause your connection to close. There are no options for resizing or locking on participant feeds. There are no call quality adjustments. There is no way to start a call in audio only mode. There are numerous other missing features as well that are too long to list here that have been available in other conferencing options for quite some time. Overall, I use this app because I have to for work, but would not recommend it unless you are locked in to the Lifesize ecosystem.",0
I just wanted to join a conference and the app forces me to sign up and register with all my information just to join a simple call. Try Zoom. Way better user experience.,0

Why is sharing screen while having the camera on are not a feature?.. sometimes students need to do a presentation with power point and face cam turn on. The fact that it is not a feature yet is a burden and a frustration smh,1
"Hey Google, love this app. It's probably the most convenient one out there. There's just one thing bugging me. Ever since a recent update (probably not the latest), we can't minimize our own tile. It covers the a corner of the screen being shared during class and won't let us see the whole screen. Is there a way to change the layout and remove our tile? If not can you please, please add it?",2
It is a nice app but the video and sound clearity is very bad,1
Hey guys. I love the app & gave 3 star rating only to ask you to clear all the unnessary bugs. Good app but not the best. It hangs in between & logs out itself. Not Bad or Not Good. Thank you. CLEAR THE BUGS AS SOON AS POSSIBILE !,1

There should be a notification to all users if the organiser of the meeting mutes their microphones,0
Wish I could share sound on mobile. All in all this is an amazing platform and it's really helped throughout these crazy times I just wish I could share sound when sharing my screen through a mobile device. I'm fortunate enough to work with an Interactive Panel typically found in classrooms and I have the zoom app and my panel can share its screen but since its read as a mobile device by the app it makes sharing sound a lot more difficult.,2

"So many bugs... Joining a meeting from a notification straight up just does nothing. Bluetooth headsets often just straight up don't even show up in the app. And ever since November 11 I am getting logged out every 24-48 hours. Chat notifications keep coming in, then I tap one and get my org's MFA login screen. This is particularly scary with the recent 9-1-1 bug that only occurs if Teams is logged out. It's a shame this app was released by such a small tech startup that can't afford QA.",0

I have appreciated zoom as a way to stay in contact with others during the pandemic. I hope to continue to use it when things open up again.,2
"Very often when opening the app, it won't actually open, it just sort of pops open and minimizes almost and then pops back open and goes through this whole cycle that it just never quite finishes. Most recently I swiped the app away, which seems to work usually, but did not seem to work. The other issue is sometimes if I open up from notifications, I can't get back to the main menu. If I click the back arrow it just closes out the app.",0
I have a nexus 6 and it keeps saying not registered,0
Sir why on opening the camera in this app tha face shows black,0

Now days the app is not working properly my daughter can't do the online classes because it is showing unfortunately meet has stopped,0
"As a lot of other users already highlighted, the app is absolutely useless. You can't join others' rooms - only if all on your team registered within a single team. It means - your clients, friends, or colleagues new to whereby will not be able to join. I couldn't connect to other dept meeting even tho I was invited So I used web on mobile. And, believe me or not - it doesn't work even in chrome (android). No sound, no opportunity to see what others share Not to mention it's just a wrapped web",0

Good but not always synced with pc,2
This app is very good for home school learning. Could you just try to make the call a bit more faster and sometimes I cannot hear the person properly? Other than that this app is perfect.,2
There was lot of audio breaks in between,0
I am not able to open assignment folders on my phone,1
"In all the communication options, I find this UI the most intuitive, the browser or App utility easier than loading a massive hunk of software to computer, communication quality good and price (free) right",2

I was asked to update to v. 5.8.6, but could not force the system to do so, even after removing and re-installing the app. Now the important meeting is over and I haven't figured out how to fix the problem, yet.",1
Clunky and connection issues. Forced undismissable notification.  You have to force quit the app to get rid of it.  This all = a bad UX. Seems more like an alpha build to be honest.,1
"I have a problem that my Bluetooth alexa does not get connect to the teams as it is connected to all other apps , as I connect Bluetooth the voice gets cut and I can't hear anything . Pls Fix the problem as soon as possible .",2

It was easy to open and started immediately without delay. However cant see other participants while sharing screen. Also the video quality was a bit blurry.,1

I have been using this app for a while but recently the sound quality has been reduced and there is echoing and other sound disturbance ...I tried reinstalling and updating but still the problem is not resolved....,1
Even after u update it...it doesnt work it shows 6 sections only.....Its quite irritating to every go to the three dots and choose the options....Since now my whole school is dependent on this app....do the needful!!!!!!!,1

This is very good app but sometimes when I am doing online class then if my some range gone when I am reconnecting my my teachers are sharing screen so when teacher came after much time then he or she admit me.,1
It;s ok,1
Great!,2
Great app. But why can't you extend the limit of 100 people?,1
140 mb update,0
This app is very nice but my only problem is that some times when the meeting will be started we can listen the organisers voice but my voice doesnt reach any one . And every one apeak answer in the meeting but how much i shout there will be no use this problem has become common nowadays please fix it and i am not able to connect to your website also,0
"We do many things very live because of zoom 😔💐.I can meet anyone right now who says I'm with them now, thanks indeed many times for introducing software like this.",2
Everything is ok but sound is poor.,2
Good One...,2

The numbers of member is only 5,0
Audio distortion,1
"We are using this for online class in my country the Philippines🇵🇭. Whats not good is the caption is truly not good because whenever i say something it write the wrong this like ""Play"" and i said and it write ""Please"" and please fix it. It would be helpful :) Ty!❤️ Ann-",2
There are only two suggestion when you chat privately there should not privately near the name it makes the perfect UI a little bit bad and the meeting settings for the participants is a bad UI,2
Internet lagging at times and connectivity issues being faced. Otherwise Format and display are excellent. I did for small group. For larger group I hope it will be the same.,1
"O.K. First my computer and phone can't have filters, only my iPad. Then sometimes when I put a filter, my video turns off and I can't on it again only if I leave. This happens every time.",1
"Very easy user interface. Did lose connection, but not sure that wasn't on the side of my Wi-fi.",2
Very hard to hear,0
"I love the app it is very easy to use, and the quality of its sound is very okay I really like it",2
It's wonderful to use it but the matter rises on connection,1
"i had some trouble with cpu getting hot so i pluged in , the other person couldnt hear me sometimes...so i think it all worked out just fine thank you for Webex and the helpful visit...sincerely sister ivy rogers",2
"GoToMeeting accesses a lot of data. I can buy 250MB of data, it will take just 2 days.One thing I like from GoToMeeting is that u can see the attendees.",1
Zoom is still better coz Webex lags a lot.,1
Audio and Connectivity issues associated when using desktop however mobile usage didn't have any lag or issue,0
Wow,2
"Good apps but the problem is when i'm in meet, it will auto left me every 30 seconds so I must rejoin so I can join again in the meet.",1
Good👍,2
Bad,0
Like it,2
"Connection kept fading, otherwise its a useful tool.",2
It hanged a lot these days and everytime I take online tuition the teacher is not able to hear me this happens every day like it's kinda frustrating Edit: I did what the developer said and now it is working properly thanks a lot for solving my query I am increasing my stars to 5,2
This app gets too big. Over 250 megs of useless media people keep posting. It needs to stop caching all that on my phone.,0
I am fed up of error code 104103. It is too irritating. Whenever I join it says error code 104103. Please fix it. Otherwise it is the best option for online class. I am loving it but error code 104103 is just stupid. It comes even if ur network is fast. Please fix it. It's a big request. If u fix it than I am gonna give it a five star ✨,0
Good app,2
use full,1
This app is cool but coming straight to the point whenever I turn my video on I definitely leave the meet I tried to update the app But it's not updating no background changing option I have schools n this is pathetic we have to use this app everytime n this is jog at all updating very disappointed I wish my school reopens n also one of the main reasons is this app can't attend my class properly without leaving a thousand times,0
My network is fine but I'm not being able to load assignment.,1
Ok,2
This is the only app on my phone who's icon doesn't accommodate Android's icon customization settings. Surprised by that. No issues with my other Microsoft apps.,2
"Too finicky, Zoom is much better and free!",1

My audio not audible to meeting organizor,0
Awaiting experiences.,2

"Now for some reason whenever i have online class and when the lecturer is showing their screen, i can see my video camera or my icon floating there and unable to move it, therefore covering a part of my screen, please fix this",0
Audio can be a problem,2
okay,0
Screen sharing ability is poor. If you share one screen and it's not full size then the participants see a small screen in the middle of their viewer rather than the shared content occupying their viewer. This greatly affects the ability to share a document and take meeting notes at the same time. Zoom is better in this regard. Also webex doesn't consistently display all meetings across devices causing me to miss meetings.,1
The app has sound issues where one persons voice is too quiet and then the voice doesn't even come threw so I'll see their mouth moving but no sound. And it seems to gave a hard time connecting to internet steadily matter how strong the signal is and the picture freezes randomly as well. I prefer Zoom! Wish zoom was more secure so anyone could use it!!,0
"Zoom is a life unto itself I say this Because, when the world 🌎 stopped (2019) Zoom pick up where the world left off⚘ A Beacon 🔦 And can continue to be a light for good if used properly ❣",2

"I am getting the problem of screen on and off like blinking even my network is fine... Screen got off, just sound comes... It disturb very much while I m in my online class... It is frustating too.. And also we cannot delete the chats we did or others replies...",0
"Very few issues, if ever. Great application, very easy to use.",2
"Glitchy have to end audio and restart, video freezes and have to restart, once it warms up (for lack of better terms) it actually is pretty good.",0
Works,2
"Good app, but it has a few problems such as lag and buffering issues. Overall, it's quite useful and has the potential to be a great social platform to connect people across the world. The app has room for improvement, but still a great app.",2
Audio sometimes are not cleared,1
Nice but sometimes it automatically log me out,1
Poor UI. No way to make one person video to stick. Always changes to the person that speaks. It is quite annoying that the lock option doesn't work.,0

Well worked but too much consuming data.,1
No access to billing information,0
Please don't use this the worst app ever,0
Very good audio and video.,2
"Having worst experience with the recent updates. While going full screen, it shows a huge tab for myself with me name initial, I don't what's the purpose for that, I don't find it of any use. For whatever reason it is there, it shouldn't be cause whenever going full screen it hides the display for most of the screen, making it impossible to get what's going on in that part of screen.",0
Not able to download any pdfs,0
Very useful when u cannot go into office for in pwrson meeting,2
"Works for me. Sometimes a bit of hassle getting a session started, but not so much that I've taken any time to find tutorials oe whatever. Thanks.",2
Great system to keep in contact with my group. Security has always been forefront with goto meeting.,2
There was an echo no one can see my camera and i can't see others camera the audio was breaking up but this app is better than zoom that's why i am giving three star rating,1
This is good.😊,1

Presentation material was exellent. The app did show me the visual but l have to use the cell for the sound.,2
Nice,2
convenient and easy,2
Useless app microphone not works itself it works like ughhhhh..... 😥,0
You cannot see what you type on chat because the keyboard gets in the way. The textbox doesn't adjust to be viewable.,1
I don't like this app because of laging too much don't dowload this app please i request you don't,0
Very poor,0
Very good,1
I like it as it is convenient but i disliek it cos it could only have on screen. So it is either i chat or i see files and sharepoint is slow and not very friendly somehow,1
Vry fun,0
It's has nice view and sound,2

Am not able to hear any sound,1
"The volume, I can hear well, something is wrong.",0
Sometimes sound is lost. Over all it is good.,2
This application is helpful but my front camera of Google meet becomes dark when I on the camera. It is a great problem.,1
the audio clashing is a bit hard to keep up with and it would be nice to have a full size display of who is talking through the phone app. It was fairly easy to keep good conversation.,1
When i need to update it. It took 3 days pls chage this i did not like this alot and in a meeting i all ways get error so pls fix this all all good,0
"This app is good but there is a problem I can't see raise hand button , my other friends can see but why can't I see?? (Edit) : Thank you now I can see the raise hand button",2
Nice app but when I teach then some times chat box not work do definitely you have to work on it...,2
I really wished that there was light and dark mode and better settings. And that there were improvement in user interface,1

"This stupid app is as bad as a trash can outside your house! This app has good performence and looks realy good, but it slows my computer and sips a lot of power from my poor battery. This ugly bullcrap battery guzelar!",0
App is good but sometimes doesn't allow you to join the meeting even though the network is good (also if you are late).,0
"Very useful for working from wherever. Observed some users having issues configuring meeting settings on the fly. I recommend finding a way to call into a meeting on computer and mobile at the same time, add the ability to more easily switch meeting audio/video between devices for ease of use and to prevent feedback. Auto feedback cancellation or auto muting would be nice features for those less technical users.",2
This app is good but sometimes it interferes with hearing and speaking that's why I am giving one star only,0
Much improvement is needed,0
this is the best free conference call service for group collaborations where everyone needs to talk and be heard.,2
Worst app cant switch between wifi and mobile data its show reconnecting if you have stable mobile data also really bad experience but have to stick to it due to clg,0

Great app for passing viral information to colleagues.Keep it up,2

Updating of everyone's status doesn't seem to happen unless I leave the app open. Everything else generally works as it should.,1
"I am giving zoom 5star, it has helped us to stay connected since COVID-19, secondly midnight meeting where most people can't leave their children alone due to insecurity zoom has been the best place of our meeting.",2
Sound quality must be improved,1
Awesome,2
Love this app. Brings the group closer and e can communicate more effectively than before. It needs a better member removal from the chat feature.,2
"You can download your data... but only while you're a member. If you leave an organisation, you can no longer download your data, which is sad.",1
This Too Poor.. Connection show down always,0

Sound quality (very important to me) was just right. Skin tone quality of participants did justice and was real. I'm impressed with this app.,2
Just now I'm  try this .,1
"We have been successful with a few meetings and although sometimes video is choppy or sound is off, generally this app is an effective and efficient meeting place.",2

In this app the more network is needed.i think it should be devlopded.😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😒😒😒very very very garbage app my class is going on and the meeting Is over. Because of this app and the power is cut off then immediately the meeting would be end I think not just updating the screen is not enough just change the setting also that it will not need so much network,0
ok,1
i can't add a bio and the notifications keep popping up as long as i don't open it. it's kind of annoying at this point.,1
Difficult to determine if your video is active and you are muted or not.,1

Audio is very feeble. Needs improvement. Beep during participant's entry should be stopped as it is irritating while listening to meeting especially with feeble audio,1
"Why I can't I custom the background for my camera, I'm using android phone😆",1
People with poor line can't connect perfectly to this app,1

Some times when I'm trying to answer it doesn't open the file the due date was yesterday because of this bug I can't open the file please fix this bug overall this app is good,1
I would've given a 5 stars if it were not for the fact that it is a very slow or no response to the send button of the chat room. This needs to be updated as soon as possible because my participation in my teams meeting seem lacking due to this issue,1
Nice,2

Actually this app I have downloaded for my child's school but she always complaints that the screen is black and she can't hear anything and sometimes also can't join. This is good app. People on phone can't remove profile picture so I think that the makers can make a feature that person using phone can also remove profile picture,1
Nitin,2
I think this app is bad,1
Nowadays I am not able to join the meeting. There problem in audio and screen sharing. I am missing out my important school classes. My app is up to date and I've tried everything but nothing is working . Please try to understand and solve the issue.,0

nice app but I cannot set background and filter in my phone and my friend can do it so I give it only 3 stars,1

Does the same thing as the site,2

Good but doesnt have a filter option,2

"Very buggy app, messed up my phone. Uninstalled now",0
I've got an important chat from a meeting I cannot access again. Make chats accessible after meetings.,1
"Does not interface well with Android Auto when on Bluetooth. For example, if I have a Bluetooth headset connected to my phone, when I plug my phone into my vehicle with Android Auto, the audio does not transfer to the vehicle but also disconnects from the headset, only allowing audio through the phone's speaker. I must disconnect my headset then leave and rejoin the meeting to resolve. When attending a meeting from a mobile device, the video is also automatically cropped for other viewers on computers. This can be resolved by turning the phone into landscape mode. Teams LIVE events are also buggy. The video of the presenter will be cropped if they are presenting on mobile with no ability to adjust viewing zoom or which part of the cropped video is shown. I can only see about 1/3 of the presenter screen. The audio also stops when the screen is turned off.",0
Nice,1

Relying on using this App to connect to a conference was a huge mistake. It didn't connect me and kept on kicking me out from the conference. Why is the product made when basic functionalities can't work? Even Google login failed in the beginning.,0

"We used the free version of UberConference for our social group to meet. Many of our members are older than Generation X, so we needed a conferencing tool that was easy to use for our older members, and UberConference did not disappoint. We even liked the fact that the 45 minute limitation was removed during the bulk of the pandemic. Since we needed to meet via this medium for at least one more month, we did upgrade to the paid version. For social groups, can't go wrong!",2

Good app for meeting but this is not at all I mean I really appreciate this but I think zoom makers should also add some more features I know when we update itadd new feature but some problems like I recommend to treat it like sometimes it doesn't let me in and the zoom sometimes it doesn't respond.please don't makers fix it and sometimes it takes to tell me that there is no internet connection but internet is on this is a good for meeting but it is not at all good for online classes. 🙏❤️,2

"I expected the App to perform like being on the computer, but it really fell short.  First, when I dial in a conference, it exits the app and dials via the phone. So this really is a phone dialing app. When my calls drop there is absolutely no way to get back in again from the app. You would think there's a button that let's me dial back in. The app has no useful functions on the call. Just dial in from your phone and save a lot of headache. And microphone drop off is a common problem.",0

Memory hog and cant really tell if you are using the desktop app. On wifi if the quality changes your calls drop. The chats section repeatedly loses all its data and need to be reset or reinstalled to get them back if a pull down refresh doesn't cut it.,0

"Okay, so first of all, is the app an absolute life saver for Pandemic online meetings, Maybe yes...And also no....There are so many updates and the updates are making the app even worse and typically hard to use..So would be better if the next update contains the Google Meet that we used on Feb or March 2020 but with the new features...So it would give us a nostalgic type feeling and new features too... Thank you, please reply me with the name ""Kabir""",1
Best app,1
In my meet no futures like baground no update is thear,0
Horrible video feed,1
Coz is very good,0
While using this my battery will drain like hell. Device gets heat very fast.,0
Interface wasn't as intuitive as it could be. Also the means with which to connect to video/audio varied in a way that made the experience feel cumbersome.,0
"Very poor user experience. No 'Settings' option. Call starts directly with Video enabled (even if you don't want it to). Hangs randomly in the middle of calls, with no 'Menu' as such to navigate to. No option to see who are the other participants in the call. Use it only because my organization has purchased a long term contract. DESPERATELY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT!",0
The best,2
Stupid app always removes from the server waste of time,0

Too slow,0
"Too bad condition in starting it has worked properly but after few weeks the app is not opening only you can open it just by the link generate by the other people cannot do anything. Now, it is not showing the schedule that are made only we need to join the schedule by the link only because of this I am not able to join my metting. After an update the app is not opening even if I restart it or restart my phone also only you can do it by unstalling it and signing up again. I prefer not to install",0

Keeps logging out.,0
Need improvement...,2
"Just used this app and found it needs a lot of work... Lacks support for multi-windo (which is standard for Android now), can't select other cameras on the device (which is a basic oversight), doesn't have a way to septate audio from video in a single session, Samsung DeX mode is completely unsuported which isn't surprising but WFH makes this needed. Basically this isn't competitive with other UCs in available.",0

App works fine except for incoming calls using Microsoft Phone System. The microphone volume is way too low for anyone to hear. This affects all our Samsung Galaxy phones of varies model types.

Gave up in the end as they just seem to be putting me off for an obvious issue / failing.,0

Good app but not happy with the status not being updated in the app in real time. Only option I find is to close the app and reopen it. Not sure whether it's an android 12 issue or the app.,1
When it works it works fine. updates are problematic. you may not get fuctionality because versions are not fully compatible and there is no warning to tell you what the problem is. you are left on your own to figure out who needs to get an update and even figure out that is the problem.,1

"Great product - easy to use, feature rich, solid performance, works every time, and it's free. What more could you need?",2
I have attended many meetings using this platform,2

"The app isn't optimized for online Classes. It has many audio issues.Plus it can't run on medium-low bandwidth.Lately there has also been an issue of PIP mode. Also, It becomes a long process if I want to reply to any message as Chat option is deep inside. Please fix these issues",0
Audio failed,0
In India language,1
"Stuck in a ""please sign in"" loop. I have the correct password, and I'm still getting notifications in the Team chat on my phone, but when I open the app, it prompts me to log in. This is a new issue.",0
The app is great but can I even have background change option for lenovo tab m10fhdrel andriod10,2
Good,1
This thing also come in meet,0
This app is great for large group conference. But the recent version of zoom is not good. My laptop audio was affected when I updated the app. Hopefully this will be resolved.,1
Good,1
Test meeting is very nearly useless.,1
"Worst app , after update it has lot of bugs , glitches , I have been using it nearly 2 years due to COVID-19 , everything was fine but now , it's the worst app",0
Works as expected...it did. Now voice volume changes up and down and camer switches itself on by itself when joining meeting...not good thing,1
This meeting app is very nice and safe also . It has good audio and video .This is also easy to use .,2
Best,1

"Usually I only get a message that the meeting has started but I can't join it, unless I restart the app. Double authorisation is messy too. The Teams app asks me for a code from the authorisation app, but the latter one asks me for code from the Teams app... The issue has been resolved but it happened multiple times to multiple people in my class (online lessons and stuff). Also sometimes it randomly switches to light mode? What's up with that?",0
Exceptionally good,1
Very nice app. Perfect for using in workplace.,2
"Sound quality weak.Some static and dropped words. In Pittsburgh, Pa",1
Why we can't unmute ?,1
Take up a lot if battery but help in other ways,0
So many areas are there your team need to work. Assignment doesn't load or open even after clearing the cache and temporary files. I would not like to recommend anyone to work on TEAMS. .,0

I am using MS Teams from the last 2 years. I have found a wonderful experience in meetings. This APP is very user friendly.,2
"Very bad video quality . In my online class I can't see my teacher's video well , it's blur and hazy .( I've updated it recently) Audio quality is not satisfactory also. I request to fix this problems so that I can attend my online class without any problems .",1

"Hard to use, hard to host on the phone or tablet as well...",1
Very good,2
Efficient and productive It has indeed played an essential role in saving time and energy to travel around the world to meet and discuss different issues. The benefits of the meetings have not been impacted at all by holding it virtually Thank you Many families are grateful for you,2
"The Teams mobile app is full of bugs and missing functionality compared to the desktop version. I was able to join a meeting, but no matter what I tried, I couldn't seem to unmute myself despite giving the app permissions to my microphone and camera. It was also impossible to tell when I was muted or unmuted, because when I tapped the mute icon, nothing would change. It turns out I was always muted, regardless of what it displayed. There's also no way to make a test call to verify my settings.",0
"Zoom has glitches frequently now, Takes a lot of time to connect to meetings. All other apps are working fine, and even the internet connectivity is exceptionally good, but zoom just doesn't connect.",0
It is very good and interesting app for all the users who want to take online seesions.,2
"Hi Google team ! This is not good not bad, good why because it can add many people in the meeting bad why because the features which are available in laptop or pc that features are not available in mobile phones or tabs so see that you make the features available in mobile phones also in tabs . Thank you",1
Very useful,2
"It is a nice app to get things organized but it always keeps saying in the middle of my online classes that Microsoft teams stopped responding. It sometimes starts installing the app again, it only happens with this app. Sometimes, it gets so many glitches and takes hours to recover. It is a extremely slow app. Always stops responding. In my online exam I couldn't submit easily on not always on time. my father and I've to get into it and keep trying. mostly homework takes years to load.",0
Not that bad,1
This app is easy to use but why can my phone raise hand up?but my other android phone can? PLS FIXS YOUR APP UP!!,1

Very bad audio and video. Hardly can hear anything,0
"This app is terrible, it lets you log in once go to the meeting and the next week you try to go back to the meeting you can't log in. Plus it's got some other things that you MUST purchase in the background. Wouldn't recommend to anyone!",0
I do not change my background 😡😠😠😠😠,0

The last update lags so much,0
Easy to use and works well. Great functions such as also being able to access files.,2
Easy to use,2
This is the first time I have installed the app.I hope I will get good support through this.,2
"What i love about the update on google meet is that we can change our backgrounds even if we only use our cellphones and another thing is, that they even put a limit data usage on the settings that would help those students who use Data for their online class. Thank you for this and I hope that you continue to do a great Job. Thank you and God Bless.",2
Every thing is nice but it doesn't connect to Blue tooth please work on it,1

You have 2 best option improove or not to improove ..... ........ .............,2
Hi. We regularly use this app. Its quite good. Only problem we have is when using mobile app tat time in video conference we can only the one who is talking and others cannot be seen like laptop. If this feature is added that during video conf at least 4 faces can be seen together in one screen then it will help us,1
good one,2
The sound was bad in the beginning and we all had to turn off our videos 😔,1
Android version 11 and octa core processor still can't change virtual background well done apps,0
Good app but if we get disconnected than it is very hard to join I love this app but you need to make it just like zoom app if it gets disconnected than it will automatically rejoin again Thanks for the app 😄😄😄,1

It failed to download on my phone,0
Keeps signing me out after the recent update. Need to sign-in again. Any ideas how to stop this?,1
"Sometimes the screen is black and in other occassions I literally can't see the screen shared by my teachers, even when I switch to other devices, but overall a good experience, it's good to have multiple device used the same acocount, especially when one of the device lacks necessary accessibility like camera or microphone.",2
"Yup. and the electronics racism which says ""designed for phones"". What about tablets? :(",0
"It's was a great app. I was using it for my online classes but lately, I'm not able to connect to meetings. Either the page is stuck at 'connecting' or I'm able to enter but I can't hear what teacher is saying nor can I see the screen shared. What can I do to solve this?",2
Easy usage and video quality was good. No ads inside the app.,2
Experience of app is good but I'm having one issue i.e. When comments are being scrolled in meeting it is displaying older comments in top place but we need new comments which need to be displayed at top which help us to know what's going through in comments section please give option for that.,0
Excellent plateform for any institute members to link them together as a single unique community.,2
Worst metting app i have ever seen because my school takes online classes on this app.,0
"Bluetooth headphones don't work with this app. When my Bluetooth headphones are connected to my phone, pixel 5a, teams still plays audio through the device itself. I don't see any Bluetooth audio or mic options.",0

"My zoom app mobile recording is not workingThis application is good for education business and other meeting point of view.This very helpful to make students clear things ang we can teach students according to planning the screen share, chats and other privacy options are excellent and make this application More useful............ i am using zoom basic and I am satisfied it is an unpaid version of zoom which is 40 minutes meeting..,I am happy and satisfied from this zoom application ,",1
"Very handy because it gives a separate platform for work. So easy to navigate, too!",2
Hard to use on phone if there was ab option to comment only give half a star that what i would press cause this app is garbage for phones,0
Nice app working properly it's working smooth in Android 10 I don't know why it's having issues on others phone nevermind I will give 5 star but add a feature that tells you when will your meeting start so it would be more good I sometimes forgot when will my meeting start and get scolded so pls add this feature than you 🙏🏻,2

"Quite annoyed at the features, especially with the leave conference requiring multiple clicks. One click should end my meeting, no confirmation required.",0
"05/2/04/21 : Liked hide people with no video, but showing blank boxes is still the same as no video. Could consolidate all the video from no video. That way we can see all the people with video on one screen. Original: Dial in, hear them, but they no hear me. 4G bad in my area. All good, but no self video.",1

"Works pretty well, but mobile has intermittent very low microphone throughput volume for multi person meetings. People on 15 person meetings can barely hear certain individuals. Volume drop comes and goes at irregular intervals regardless of location or WiFi settings. Reported it in early 2018, but no response and no fix yet. 5/24/19 Problem with others hearing me has been much better until today. Yesterday, had a WebEx app update. Problem returned. People say audio is like I'm on the moon.",1
"The app is crap, basically. Doesn't register via cellular network (t-mobile). Which is the whole point of having it on the phone. Switching wifi on and off crashes the app. In year 2017 that should not happen with someone claiming to be a professional video conference provider.",0

"Group work often involves brainstorming. I have yet to find a good brainstorming add on for MS Teams. OneNote is so limited with it's formatting and the MS whiteboard is really clunky, even though it has ""brainstorming templates"" they are pretty hard to use. I am still trying to learn all the tricks with Teams. Adding an app tab if you're not the General channel ""owner"" is not allowed/UI bugs out when I search a team to add it to. It lets a non owner add app tabs to a chat channel though.",1
User friendly app and easy to use.,2
The is not that much nice,1
Good app for meeting👍. After update the app in the last month. But some time it shows failed to join if i had full internet access. 😡,1
"Was the best a few years ago, but its lack of features compared to its competitors has forced our company to use other services. I just had a call on gotomeeting and it's like using dial up internet or a flip phone, technically still functional, but why use it. So far behind the times.",0

Why does this app drinking my data like a drunkard drinking alcohol. I just used it for 3 hours without using my mic and camera even it used 1gb of my data. There is only one camera and mic on through out the time. It's very difficult for students to attend all the classes like this. I hope u look into this issue...,0

"After update of app on 10th Dec 2021. Not able to open any pdf, jpg, word in assignment tab.",0
Very nice app,2
I won't rate this app a 5 star! It's one of my least favorites.. I don't know why but even after having full WiFi connection it still doesn't work..but the best part is that it works well..all features are very easy to use and If there was no such problem I would have rated 5 stars!😁 I hope they do some changes ☺️,1
"Go to meeting is good, it is some how good with limited participants. The success of the meeting depends on the organizer who has to mute and unmute the audio and vedio of the participants.",1
"Great, easy to use and carry out meetings during this time of concern.",2
Awful experience compared to other options. App based audio poor even with good connection. Very slow to load shared screens.,0
It drains battery fast.,1
Worst app... Finding difficulty in connecting audio through mobile,0
That's not good,0
Worst update ever. Such a big company failing to deliver. Event page option are not opening and cannot click on anything. Don't know how it manages to roll out. Disappointed,0
this is the simplest video audio app i have ever used.,2
"The PC app is much better. This app would not let me turn useless incoming video. The incoming video ties up half of the portrait screen. I used to really like GTM, but this app is making me prefer Teams instead.",0
This app is waste banned,1
The fact that I can't get rid of the un/registered user notification DRIVES ME INSANE.  This is definitely an app I will be installing and uninstalling as needed.,1
"Today Suddenly the App asked me for a login and after login was hanging and stopped working ... And I had to struggle for online class of my Child. And on laptop when the app is used the camera doesn't work. When used in online login outside the app, the camera is working. Pls check and do the necessary changes, so that People and Children will be able to use the app with more ease.",1
Video conference,2
A very good app for meeting the feature is very good and relevant No prob in this App But sometimes network prob Error Is a prob plz repair Bcz when Network Is low meeting automatically disconnected,2

Good one.,2
Nice app,2
Good but the problem sometimes u cant join its automatic black screen,0
"Teams app works pretty well, although when your PC is off, a person's status (available, etc ) defaults to status of the app on your phone. So when you sign off your pc, you need to do double work and specifically set your Teams status on your phone as well",1
Great. Much better than zoom. Better mobile interface.,2
Pls set option to share audio sound in tablets and mobiles too Also pls start filter and background options in tablets and mobiles too,0

"There is one issue regarding swtiching the account in the application. I am having two different accounts in the microsoft and password of both the accounts is also different, so when I swtich from one account to the another, it is showing me the error.",0
Just doesn't work. All I get is a white screen. A real let down as I really like the desktop/web version :-/,0
good luck,2
I use it everyday and it is very easy for cloud people to hear from each other,0
It's very good app for online meeting,2
Great app but keeps telling me to update. Really annoying especially when you have an urgent meeting to log in to.,2
No Wow,0
This is theThird time iam downloading this app . But I can't able to login I entered my email I'd and password correctly but I can't able to login with same I'd and password I don't no what the reason is?,0
"The new update contains a lot of bugs. Unable to turnon the video, consumes battery a lot.",2
"I like the mobile app but there are a few things that the mobile app doesn't do, which it should. It does not update chat to show ""seen"" when the chat has already been viewed in the Windows app. (You have to go into each chat thread separately to unhighlight them.) Like the Windows app, it does not always remove the Activity flag even when you've viewed the Activity in either a chat or in the Activity screen.",1
"It is awsome with lots of options like calender, assigent etc. But after I update the app I am not able to sign in. Then I have to uninstall and again install it.",1

"Hello Google, I like this app very much because it's lag-free and fun to use. The only thing I saw is when I tried to join my class today, after 18-38 seconds the app crashes and when I join again and after 18-38 seconds again it crashes so this continues. Please fix this... I'll give you 5 stars ✨",2
Speaker phone get off in between meeting,1
App hangs too much and use a lot of data,1
Works on my smart phone...not on my computer. No one can hear me on/from my computer.,1
Nice and amazing for classes and nice organisations but one problem is it is always signing out. Thank you🙏🙏💐,2
Q banaye be dimag kharab online classes bhi nhi hote agr ye nhi hota toh 🤣,1
"Too finicky, Zoom is much better and free!",1
This thing eats data for breakfast,1
Good,2
I love this app for video conferencing but there is no screen recorder in it and if I call someone or pickup call of someone it just's leaves me from the meeting. Althrough good app for bussiness meetings or online classes for students.,1
Fine,2
Easy to use and doesn't eat up memory the way ***m does.,2
Speaker view obscures too much of the information on the slide. Needs to be smaller or relocated. I will return to seeing webex via chrom browser.,1
Best conference call platform and app that I've run across so far....,2
It was working well but now it gives many trouble. I can't even change my profic picture. When I try to change it get removed or come back to the same as pervious. Fix this issue.,1
The app is really good but whenever I try to open any doc file it's not opening it say it's crashed or something so to open the the doc file I have to go to the chrome and open it and it's not comfortable because even though you have an app you can't open it.,2

Not able to join session using mobile data. It is working fine only with wifi.,0
please remove my camera view from full screen when I'm not using mic or camera. What's the use of full-screen if you gotta add a floating camera box over it. Change the mic icon to botton with a little round corner in red when in full-screen.,0

Audio system change option not ok,0
Still early to judge.,0
"Poor audio, regardless of device used to connect. Otherwise is reasonable service.",0
Surprisingly easy to use and navigate despite the complexity it offers. Reliable and quick. Crucial to our productivity these days. Bloody great app.,2
"I am having a nice experience on meet as a student. But only the problem is in new version, if we are pressing home button we don't leave from the class and our video is visible. It is actually a option for some students to not to leave the meet, keep video on, while playing games. But it is good in one way for our teachers that they can keep a check on children while exams.",2
Good. We can understand easily.,1
Aweful and complicated,0
aliii,2
It is good,2
Ok for most part hard to get in to meeting on phone even after I installed app had to go to email link and get in the meeting that way . Also there should be a way to flip video for other s that have there phone on the side . There might be a way to flip but I was in able to find it . But it's cool and working as should . Good work .,2
So far so good. No problems or issues. Video and sound quality have been very good.,2
Let's try,1
Good,2
Improvement needed,1
"Used this twice, both times it's worked out very well. The non-profit organization I work with is using this to keep our Board Members up to date. Not perfect, but works really well.",2
Speaker option no longer available since upgrade. I use this on my mobile phone and noticed the speaker option is no longer available. That is really inconvenient as I have to hold the phone to my ear. If you can fix that I will give you your stars back.,0
Easy to use. Very clear signal. Affordable. Continues to meet and exceed expectations.,2
App is good but itz connection issue is horrible whenever I try to enter in any meeting it shows connecting and I have wifi connector itz internet speed is very fast but also it's not connecting plz fix this connection problem.,1
I can't change my background.,0
"The only complain i have is for zoom not having volume slider on the other person in the room. Sometimes some people's mic are just to loud, and sometimes some of their voice volume is too small",1
My app while conducting a meeting suddenly getting disconnected automatically with full wifi coverage.its getting disconnected and my home screen is appearing.kindly help to resolve,1
Good than zoom,1
Betty Power very low for this app use 🙄,2
"It's a perfect app for secure meetings. You don't need to chat with anyone if you don't want to you chat with anyone unless you accept there invitation, and it's good",2
"I think Webex can improve much more, because it's ok, but there are some big problems with it. It can lag a lot and actually crash sometimes if you're in a meeting, which is very annoying and the video streaming has a poor quality. The video sharing system lags and sometimes it bugs out and shows a glitched screen, when a teacher is presenting, where you can't see anything but a grey, white, or black background with weird highlighting of text, which is a problem with the code of the application",1
Very good picture and communication,2
Since the Covid quarantine this method of active virtual participation has been a wonderful resource for me and the others who join our facilitator on a bi-weekly meeting day and time.,2
Works really well. Good service!,2
It is good app for interacting with teachers and learning online directly through your organization..but there are some glitches which sucked the students like when we put on hold and then when we resume it our mic is not muted...so fix this issue asap...,1
Recent update made buggy.,1
This is very super app,2
"The app is a joke. If you want to get anything accomplished, use the website. There are several app features that do not work. For example, adding new individuals to a conference. I keep getting the message unable to process and the invitees are not saved or invited. Please update the app and make it usable.",0
good,2
Love how intuitive this app is,2
Shotty linux cloud proprietary hardware. Just use Zoom or anything else.,0
"Hate it. keeping track of all the work groups is ridiculous, if using this for work, limit the group capabilities. the constant sign in requirements are also annoying.",0
There is no new version there is no raise hand option,1
Its ok could be better need to add text messages format so when you're in meeting if you're on mute you can still text and also if you can add a format where you can write out question and answer and submit directly to an email address on this platform would better improve the experience on this sites,1
Sometime disconnecting,0
Exilent,2
"Great app for online classes, unlike an app that's name is based on a binocular's feature.",2
Takiwyou,2
I could not hear others voice and its cutting off from the call and It and my friends could not hear my voice,0
It sometimes lags and gives some errors even if internet Is working properly then also it is giving errors.,2
"Very easy to use, clear on screen options which still allowed viewing of presentations without taking over the screen.",2
Hanging,0
The best app when it comes to work. I WFH and it keeps my team and I connected without missing a beat!,2
"I use this all the time to manage a team of 130 people. It works great The one thing I wish I could have is more ways to sort chats. SO many chats and 2 ways to sort em, that are not the most helpful",2
Good app! I use 3 times a week to attend meetings for business purposes and I'm overall satisfied with app.,2
The bug which I found was whenever we once join a Google meet meeting from a gmail account and the host permits our entry then whenever we try to rejoin or join from any other device using the same Google account then our request to join doesn't reach the host and we are in the meeting which is creating a lot of troubles to various pupils as the spammers enter the meeting using a name which is known to the organisation and now when they are removed they rejoin without the host's allowance.,0
Call quality is good but conference with HD call crashes every now and then.,0
I use Teams at work and the app is fine for mobile access in a crunch. Just don't forget to logout on your days off.,2
The audio was very distorted and had extrem difficulty hearing what was happening.,1

I'm giving this application 3 starts for its good working and all. But I suggest to add 'messaging to everyone' option. Because many times we have any kind of doubt but we are not confirmed about it and for confirmation it's the best choice to ask our friend while meeting in progress.,1
best conferencing option,2
it need somehow a little servicing,1
Amazing Thank You,2
"Too much helpful in lockdowns,high quality videos and fancy backgrounds helping in live online class thanks Google Meet.",2
"It's really easy to install this app and then join the meeting on my phone. The controls go into the pull down menu on my phone , so it's easy to mute and unmute. The screen sharing is very good and the transmission is very clear.",2
Because when it was first update I installed meet when I join in my tab even now the first update features and the icon of that is there pls fix this problem then I will put 5 stars pls,1
"This app is easy to setup and simple to connect with meeting. The sound quality is great, and the picture is pretty good too. All in all, this was a great experience and I will use this in the future!",2

"I wish I could give 0 stars. It was painful rather bad experience. Now a days, exams are being held in online mode and every one is sharing links on here your platform. When , assignments are placed , they can't even open and the deleted assignments still remain there, and to a fact , I just missed my external exams. It is all your buggy application.",0

I must used this 1 or 2 year but quality is good and the meeting expierence it's good but video quality is bad its blur and voice is breaking very frequently but it's good I m giving to this app 3 star because video quality is not good if video quality Is good then 5 star but I like it ☺️☺️,1
"Unclear directions. constantly asking for registration after you are already registered. Asks for url without instructions, or necessity.",0
"Need to add co-organizers away from desktop. Also, using a headset causes 
feedback to others in meeting. Headset doesn't cause issues in skype, as an 
example.",1
Reasonably easy to use on my Android phone and not a steep learning curve. I avoid social media like the plague and I was able to get right into using it for a meeting. Audio and video were also fairly good. Pretty good for the free version.,2
"It is very helpful and i am very thankful for the service. It is easy to use but there is one issue with this is that I cannot change my name like zoom. It will join with the registered no. of mobile. So, I hope that there should be a solution for this problem. Thanks 🙏🏻",2
Voice n picture clarity n quality problem. There should be some option to mute the sound-irritating one-while people join meetings.,1
Fine,2
Used to work fine in the beginning but now the meeting is not connecting. Not eligible for 5 star rate Gets disconnected every now and then doesn't join the meeting. There was a lot of problem.,0
Just a wrapper around the website.,0

Awful,0
"Almost as good as the PC version. My only criticism is when I am in a meeting, this blasted app acts like it is in a real phone call and uses the proximity sensor, which causes the screen to flicker on and off whenever it senses an object in front of it (VERY annoying). Please add an option to turn this on and off!",0
Nice,2

Ok,1
It's great but it always says I need to update but I already updated,1

This is very useful and very Smart aap I like it,1
This is good but after some long it facing too problem .I don't know why.,0
I enjoyed the App only for two days to be precise. There has been serious interruption in my conferences recently. It goes off in the middle of the conferenc (prayer meetings). You can imagine how embarrassing that could be. People think you are inefficient. Within a space of 30 minutes it disconnects 3 to 4 times and people get frustrated and walk away on you.,0
Great app.,2
"Thx teams!! Although I had poor internet, it still worked! I am surprised and shocked! Non of my applications worked that good! But i give it 4 stars cuz sometimes the screen don't show.. thx for help! I appreciate this app it's awesome!",2
I'm using this for my korean language schooling. The features were quite good and working so well even my teacher and classmates were from different country.,2
App is so funný,2
Experience is getting worse with each update. I have to touch the icons multiple times in the bottom tray to load the correct view. Performance is spotty at best. Chat seems to be the hardest view to load consistently. Notifications do not link very well to the team pages or threads when your name is mentioned. Overall the app is much more difficult to use than it should be.,0
Sign......,1
Not good,0
I will never spend money again with them. Such a rip off had one meeting under an hour and had me and one other person was expecting more and no one else showed. Zoom is charging the $15 for the month and the customer service rep. Said there were 4 people in the meeting lol such a lair.,0

Half the time I try to click a work link it tries to force me to log in but then refuses and forces me back to the log in screen. I am just trying to sign in as a guest.

"Horrible stability for a long time since some update. When I open Teams, it can perform ""reload"" like 5 times. Has poor sync with servers, so notifications come with a delay compared to desktop version (that has similar notification issues). Constantly signs off me, so I need to relog. Overall interaction with app feels laggy, animations may glitch, actions take too long to perform. It's usable, but I'm shocked how bad things are in such a popular app.",0

Really great app. True to its purpose - online meetings and every other feature you'd want with it.

Nice App,1
Teams is convenient and helpful in many ways. I wish it were easier to manage sharing a screen and still keeping the video present across monitors. I used three monitors and teams behaves erratically sometimes in that the controls move as I share and unshare and sometimes it's difficult to use and manipulate controls and windows while I'm also trying to present. I wish you were possible to anchor it in a particular place where I could reliably alt tab back and forth to it.,1
Works well,2

"The interface is hard to get used to. I wish it were easier to toggle to and from the various menu options between chat vs a teams group, etc. Also, having a contacts list from maybe outlook come up would be convenient versus having to automatically know the person's name to type in. I'd be nice to use teams for people also outside of your team/company without needing to set up a meeting.",1

"The quality was poor to begin with. With every new update it gets worse. Another case of adding features and ignoring the bugs in the system.

One minute, I can see that I'm in the group. The next minute, I'm gone and the screen says that the room if full. That's a video call with my doctor and me.",0

"The app itself works nice, and sound aspect is commonly decent. Nonetheless the absence of android auto integration is a main disappointment. Incoming calls cannot be responded and discussions cannot be gathered (obviously i want these to be audio only for safety reasons).",0
This app is very poor because I couldn't hear voice of organzier and the audio option doesn't open. I need not attend the class.,0
"Switching between accounts has been my biggest issue. I haven't been able to use it successfully with a personal and work account. It crashes or forces me to use one over the other. When I log out of my work account, the app forces the login when I open it again. I just decided uninstalling was the best option.",0
Awesome service and clear sound!!!!,2
Good,1
This is very good app for ironing clothes. you can iron your clothes anywhere from your mobile . I iron my cloths from my mobile simply I run this app . After few minutes my mobile will get hot then I start ironing on my cloths . This app is asking to Bluetooth on before using this app. Battery is go down in 59 minutes meeting . I can't attend more than one hour meeting.,0
Works well when needed to interact with multiple people in one setting.,2

"all and all the teams app is good, simple to access work and chats i do wish profile pictures could be GIFS as well but other then that I'd say it's perfect 👏 👌",2

I kerp getting kicked out or when i sign in i can not hear anyone.,1
Voice quite clear,2
Is the best,1
UI can be more user friendly. It takes long to disconnect after meeting. Video quality is very poor.,0
"Worked ok, didn't want video of me going out, and required permission to turn on and record stills/video, so that worked out ok. Some how to connect audio, thru internet for me, also worked. Takes a while to learn the interface, not that different than Zoom or Jitsi, so figured it out, gave me some tech to do during mostly talking. 20211212 another, this didn't work at all, unuseable, maybe connection date/time, complained on cert, etc",1
Enterprise-level chat client! Overall very good piece of software. Microsoft continuely improves the quality and feature set. A+,2

"From the last two - three days, the app is not working well . Like if you try to open any pdf or word file which is assigned to you in the assignment section , it's not opening in smartphones.",1
Terrible,0
It was seamless moving from Skype to Teams. I love the other options Teams provides regarding document sharing- it helps to make our Team more efficient!,2

"It's very good bahut badhiya aage jayiye lazabab aap hai ,in fact Can't even sit in the meeting, because it would have opened itself very quickly, only under 10 hours, the remaining 2 hours, would ask for so much information as we do not know about ourselves.",2
waiting for more to be added to this before I give it anymore stars. It has potential.,1
"Much server issues, I have a 15 mb/s optical fiber internet connection but it still gets disconnected. This is very frustrating when it comes to the case of important meetings.",0

"It is a good app.. The reason I have 1 star is because I am a 12 yr old child.. I use it for online classes.. But it shows to update, then only I would be able to join my classes.. But on playstore there is no option to update it... I deleted and installed again. Nothing happened. I missed a lot of studies. Because of this I gave it 1 star otherwise it's a 5 star.. 😡",0
When I use this application so it doesn't catch my voice; and no one can listen my voice!!! 🤷‍♀️ When I meeting with anyone so it throws my outside from the meeting!!! 🤷‍♀️,0

"Nice. I recommend this app for anyone who has low bandwidth cuz I feel like this app tries to maintain the good connection with the all time during the meeting. Moreover, it is very convenient to use the app. And also I personally know that this app helps to many teachers and students to conduct their classes via online during this Covid - 19 pandemic.",2
"I HAVE to grant the camera permission now? I'm not going to use it, why do I HAVE to grant it? This is against Google play policies. You are violating them. Change this. I'm an Android developer, I know. Also there's no sound when muting and unmuting myself now? That's terrible design.",0
Always showing bugs and every time connection lost,0
No email I'd verification. No mute partcipation option. No FB and YouTube live option.,0
"Confusing interface, participants spend a lot of time trying navigate and clicking dropdowns that are really just labels. Chat typeface is Tony and non-adjusting, just to small ,even with my magnifying glass. I can't comment as to how troublesome meeting setup must be but our class instructor who is very very tech communications Davey (Cisco CCNA class) has had to renew classeide re-invites to overcome technical problem at the start of 3 out six class meetings.",1

"Choppy audio, likely as a result of meeting environment and/or my phone quality. No option to text questions, instead of speaking.",0
Could not attend with AOL so went to phone. Audio was perfect loudness then softened so I could hardly hear. I have never had a good experience with webex. I attend many virtual meetings.,0

"Worst (workplace) social messaging app. Past feeds don't show up. Important message from work don't show up. All the things you need to be working is broken.

One out of five this sucks!!! 😡😡😡😡😡 and the fact I get disconnected too many times is annoying and the chats won't even load how great thanks a lot zoom,0
"Google meet is very nice app but i had given 3 stars because it doesn't have any type of options to record the meeting with sound. Even though if we use another third party app to record meeting with voice so there is a big big ""NO"" you can record only the screen of the meeting but cannot save the recording with audio which a very dissapointing thing. I suggest to add-on this option so that users can easily record any meeting with audio without any problem and without any third party app.",1
Best of the best! Just integrate the ability to record the meetings too!,2
nic ap,2
The app is suddenly closed during video call meeting.I think it is a demerit of this otherwise the app good,1

"Does not catch my bluetooth mic's voice properly, I literally have shout in meetings, and sometimes it don't even respond , mic's problem is only with meet, my mic works properly with other apps...please do something.",0
Actually this problem occurs only when teacher is presenting his or her screen otherwise my voice is going in meet,0
Poor sound quality and the navigation needs to be more user friendly when using the phone,1
Hand raise option is not available Other wise all is good.,1
This is not good,2
Endless loop upon opening. Cannot access.,0

Great way to keep in contact with tutors online and have 1 to 1 private messages with either tutors or students and group chats that are created work brilliantly and all of the different skills you can learn from online is great.

Sound quality was bad,0
Love this app! Very simple and easy to use. No ads what's so every and easy to video chat! Recommend very much.,2
The website is far superior to this mobile app. This has little to no features and is hard to use,1
Worst app When I join a meeting it only shows connecting and if it connects then I get connect into my personal meeting . Does not deserve a single star,0
Forever logging me out and stating its 'securing my account' absolute pain in the backside.,0
"Hard to figure out, coments could not get key board up. ,thenlost audio and took time missed information on meeting 😪",0

"Annoying login every time i go the app, does not allow to join existing room by simply entering its name - it somehow allows only creating new room. Very counterintuitive interface.",0
Terrible feedback during about half of the meeting. Unsure if it was a zoom or personal computer problem of the speaker or user.,2
It is a very good app,1
Exciting but disappointed due to the poor signal of the internet,2
teams don't have blur background option for Androids and chat box is invisible in mobile phones,1
Need a location on the screen to reverse the camera angled fore front or rear facing cameras. Is very awkward trying to catch the correct frame desired by the meeting attendees. Other than that it was flowing very well,1

"This allows me to work away from the office.  Breaks my chains, so to speak.  It isn't as intuitive as it could be but technically works as well as my phone most of the time.  Also, I feel like most of the people who rate this app don't know how to rate 2, 3 or 4 stars.  They're a little bipolar.  OMG my bluetooth earpieces sucks so I'm going to rate this app 1 star!!  No Cheryl, I rate you 1 star.",2
"Very user friendly, thank you",2
The app works great but if you have slow net it will not be a great meeting cuz it lags when the net is slow so whoever says that the app does not work well you just need strong network to use it properly 😊.,2

I feel so bad with this app that I missed my online class. When I have not joined the class it says you are already in call please repair it,0
"Helpful for communication and collaboration, but has several functional and quality-of-life issues. Does not sync well over VPNs. Drops out of dark mode if left unopened for a while, and goes to blinding white. Can get in a reauthentication loop when signing into multiple organizations.",1

Stay tuned is not a description of what is being updated. If you're not going to tell me what you changed I'm not going to update anything. I got burned by Firefox devastating destruction of the best browser. Stop hiding what you plan to change. After using several virtual meeting apps it's clear that GoToMeeting is a distant second choice to zoom. Don't waste your time with this.,0
i don't like being prompted to review things. also it's a little buggy,1
superb,1
Nice for business meetings works is simple but always seems to be some minor problem solving but overall not bad,2
"Teams is a decent way for businesses to communicate. Instant messaging, screen sharing, meetings features are all possible. There are a number of intermittent delays and synchronization issues however.",1
It is very helpful for teaching to students.. But whenever I update app it will not started again.. I have to uninstall it and than again have to log in.. Some time it make me in trouble..,2

Ok good,0
Hehehege,0
"Unintuitive and cumbersome. (This review speaks specifically to the mobile version only.) - Watching videos and or recordings of previous classes doesn't have a full screen mode on mobile so you are forced to watch videos in a section of the screen making it completely redundant, unless it's being used only for the audio. - The entire experience on the app can be summed up by it being barely adequate when doing the most basic of tasks in which it sets out to do. Just a really sub-par app.",0
I am rating it two stars because if I go to anothes tab the meeting was closed .,0

When I do online classes and when my video is on it takes a lot of battery 🔋. When all the classes are over from 100 persent it comes 40 persent. It don't like this app..,0
Notifications don't work on Android but they do on iPhone - why?  Basic features on Android but full featured on iPhone - why?,0
I give only 3 stars because there is a setting of background And when I set any picture like if I set the option of blur it also blur me And when you message me how to solve the problem of raise hand so it solved but what I have to do to set background so please solve this problem also...👎,1

"This was very useful. We're doing a digital core class. And it works if everyone except the teachers mute their mics. And if you have a question, you can unmute, chime in, and mute again. CURRENT ISSUE: This may be a user issue, it may not be. But these days the link I am given from my instructor keeps telling me there is no meeting when in fact there is definitely one. I've tried to sign in, but apparently my pw is wrong, so I ask for a reset to be emailed. And I never get the reset email.",2

According to me,Google meet was better.",0
Good but lags a bit sometimes.,1
I would give 3 stars. It always has to be updated but the result is nothing like that. It remains the same. But still it is very easy to use.,1
"I am totally unable to use WebEx on my Dell desktop. Usually I am successful on my Surface Pro 3, but today everything locked up there. After 45 minutes of struggle to try and join a meeting I Really wanted to hear, I finally resorted to this newly installed app on my Samsung tablet. This app worked and in the end saved the day....but in general I HATE WEBEX.",0
Very good to contact friends and call but maybe some minor issues that could be fixed but overall very good,2
The app must get the recording feature for the host. Allow the mute any participants.,1
This is a nice app but it always shows connecting but then it disconnects i have perfect internet but still ZOOM keeps disconneting while in classes and when it is connecting but it could be better if u all can make it a little bit umm not disconnectable so i will give it 2.5 stars,0
"The speaker was great. I couldn't get the audio going but once I did, it was rather delightful.",2
"All facilities are okay... But, while using it in pc... I don't find any shortcuts for anything in this app. For example, in zoom.. If we type alt+V, It will turn on/off the video , etc....... So, please check on it...",2
This app is really good but when your on cell and it closes when you go to other apps and dosent even open,0
This app is great for friends and family or small group meetings! As long as it stays updated its been great,2

MS Teams has been of a great help lately but some features seem to be just placed as a showcase. The Data Saver feature is not literally preventing the data expenditure . As a school student I've my online classes from Teams and at the end of the day I see my data used up near 1 GB despite of turning the Data Saver on. And though it eats up my data but also the camera quality reduces drastically. I would request you to kindly make amends in the feature soon .,0
Ok,2
Great app for virtual meetings. For businesseess and friends. Just celebrated St. Paddy's day. with family and friends,2
Satisfying but need more video quality n improvements.,2
"It is very easy to use. But the latest update lags a lot. We do online classes using this app. It shows that the network is not stable 😔. Although the internet speed is 100MBPS. The network problems and video pausing are not much occuring in this app but it hangs and lags a lot. Sometimes the background blur option is not working properly, instead of blurring the background it is blurring us!! Please fix these issues fast.🙏🙏. Overall this app is the best for online classes. 3 stars ⭐⭐⭐",1

Very convenient.,2

Had some experience yesterday with this app,1
"the update is absolutely horrendous. when in full screen, your profile picture stays and obstructs your view and makes it hard to see the presentation clearly. it would be good if you have an option to view just the presentation or unpin and scroll through the profiles of the other people in the meet. please fix the floating picture and let it focus on the presentation. it's basically useless.",0
Very best app,2
The most unstable and unreliable app by MS. Won't let me sign in wih my account. Background changes were removed when I could sign in earlier. Missing out on major meetings because of this nuisance. Terrible MS!,0

It just puts me in a loop, when I press the button to open app and continually opens more web browser windows of the same page. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S9. So unless you make some adjustments, it's pointless me having the app installed.",0
Great and useful product,2
There is a provision in the app that without admin's permission no participate can present his screen and a end meeting button in admin's screen should have.,2

"What more can you ask for in an app. This is an excellent utility for those that like to get several people together on one line without many of the participants tying up multiple phone lines. On top of that, the options are great for the conference leader, mute, record and more the great thing is that many options are available free. Excellent and a must have utility app.",2

Waiting room feature is not available please provide.,0
This is nice app It Always work and not even glitches we do our meeting very easily. and the app is so easy to operate.I love it,2
Terrify experience using this app for conference as there is no link or password in your email in first place. No explanation what participants would encounter to. The last minute on the meeting participant found out that that you need to download this app and the time you figure out all the misleading and confusing procedure the meeting was already on and not allowed participants to join any more. I would not use this app for sure in future for whatever meeting will be.,0
Great experience! I love the convenience Teams offers. Thank you!,2

No sound on my phone,0
Great platform and easy to use. I use for conference calls only though.,2
cut you off when somebody calls and completely messes up the call. Should have the ability to disable incoming calling or somehow suppress callers from being able to completely interrupt a meeting.,0
Excellent intuitive conferencing. Phone calls should be simple. Uber Conference is rock solid.,2

"I expected the App to perform like being on the computer, but it really fell short.  First, when I dial in a conference, it exits the app and dials via the phone. So this really is a phone dialing app. When my calls drop there is absolutely no way to get back in again from the app. You would think there's a button that let's me dial back in. The app has no useful functions on the call. Just dial in from your phone and save a lot of headache. And microphone drop off is a common problem.",0
"The Zoom-App on Android is the lowest quality, I think they assume every Android device is a phone. (only 4-people on screen at once, and absolutely no settings for audio-mic and video-camera changes, you just get the defaults. ) I work with the Windows version and I've seen the IPad version. I've tried to see if there is some 3rd party app that will connect to Zoom-Meetings. Because the zoom-people are just not supporting Zoom-Cloud on Android. Its open-source code.",0
The audio keeps skipping,0
Good app but lots of problems...so that please fix the problem for and rest people.I'm giving 3 stars beacause of some issues,1

"Slow and a major battery hog. With Teams running in the background my batter drops 1% per minute. Without teams it is 10% per hour (1% every 6 minutes). Its utterly bonkers. Nothing like that with Whattsapp or Telegram. It obviously is very inefficient and poorly written. It can take 10+ seconds to switch to the app and the in-app chat often does not update unless I switch away and then back, whilst the incoming messages do get shown as notifications in android. A shame, as has potential.",0

Most of the times it doesn't attach.",1

Good now the quirks were worked out after start of Covid. Only complaint is you cannot get rid of lead screen in the corners when another person talks or there is screen sharing,2
Audio keeps switching from my bt headphones to speaker.,1
Not too good,1
"I cannot find any emoji packages, I tried to search and download them but it refers me to a lot of confusing websites, and sometimes it's pretty boring sometimes to not being able to react and show others how you feel about certain activities involved in the meetings that are held by this Zoom app and it annoys that you always have to update a newer version",1

The features to be able to mute,record,transcripts is good.I just got this app today and I already want to get pro because I don't want to call each and every participant to invite them seems like a time consuming task.  ***However*** I would like to atleast hear the ""hold music"" without having to call just to sample it.",2

One of the worst and also best apps because of its problem with the server it hangs down😣 and best is that due to network issue we dont get out of the meeting it provides us to stay in the meeting for a long time if there is some network problem 😊 and the sound quality is very poor 🤮 it has more bad sides than the good sides then if u r a patience person then u can try it otherwise dont,0

I have all notifications turned on. I have all permissions granted. I have battery optimization turned off. Yet, I still have no idea if there are new chats in the personal account unless I manually open the app or look on the desktop version. Why can't you get this working, Microsoft? This has been a problem all along.",0
"Extremely frustrated with this app. Authentication is such a pain with the obligatory phone call after you enter your password, and it frequently fails. If you momentarily leave the app, you have to sign in again as well...with another phone call... Additionally, there are several OTHER apps you MUST have in order for it to work. Now I'm locked out of my account because one of the other apps I need doesnt work. Functionally, Teams is ok once you're signed in, but such a terrible experience. 0/10",0

"The sign in process is poor. It forces you to input your phone number before you can use the app, but it fails to send you any verification code to confirm your phone number. After trying for more than an hour, they still haven't sent me any verification code. There's no way to use the app. Very poor design. App is totally unusable. I'm about to miss out on an important job interview because of this. Really disappointing.",0
Giving 4 stars cuz some times the camara turn off or we can't on.,2
Nice app working properly it's working smooth in Android 10 I don't know why it's having issues on others phone nevermind I will give 5 star but add a feature that tells you when will your meeting start so it would be more good I sometimes forgot when will my meeting start and get scolded so pls add this feature than you 🙏🏻,2

I LOVE this app it's awesome u can zoom with anyone.............but the problem is.....some times it freezes. Other than that I love the app!!!!!(◍•ᴗ•◍)❤,2
I love this app because if I use it for my class for 2 hour I takes more than 800 mb,0
The updated version is consuming way too much net. I have to literally stop the lecture because if it goes like that then its going to consume all of my 2GB data in just 10-20 minutes.. Do something about it,0

"It's been a long time since I've used webex. Not bad. I liked it and would have given it 5 stars but it's not quite as intuitive and it took a little getting used compared to the ""other"" app I use.",2
"Audio, video were good. I could not keep the device on landscape mode which was inconvenient",1
App is very good meetings are too good but 1 thing that is I have updated all times but no background change option is not in my mobile this is worst thing but the app is very good that's why i have given 5 star,2

Constantly tries to get you to sign in with an outlook account instead of just joining the meeting. Computer illiterate people struggle immensely with this app. Imagine if Zoom sucked.,0

It's better if u rectify this as soon as possible And one more thing it never unmute's on time it takes a lot of time which I hate Today because of this I lost my chance WORST APP,0
Screen sharing feature is unusable. Teams should work on making the screen sharing experience better. It is very had to control the pointer when screen sharing is on. I like everything else except screen sharing.,1

Better app for online teaching. Perfect video clarity with good audio facility.,2

Great phone app. However it does have some troubles running in Windows with the current security updates.,2
"Had meetings through here from other teams. When i click the link from Google Hangouts from phone sometimes it does not work, or say that the link is invalid, etc. and it was Sooooo hard, always had to copy and paste the link to web browser and HOPE it works. For desktop, When we ask them for videos, it has no sound. When we ask them for a meeting we need to set it way in advance as they are always fumbling with the sound, or video. Always something goes wrong, maybe its them, maybe its the UI",0

This honestly sucks my camera kept going! whenever I speak they couldn't hear! I can't even share my audio on my device. and whenever I close the tab for even a second I'm getting logged out.,0

"Very simple to figure out, and there was no lagging in the video feed or voice control.",2
It was a good app. But recently I am facing connection problems like it is showing error on code 104 103. Even if I have a strong internet connection. Please fix that or our school meeting will be shifted to google meet.🙏🙏🙏,0

Lots of bugs,1
"There should be Add account option like instagram as in zoom we have to logout everytime to use another I'd, it gets complicated when you're in a hurry.",1
this is just a really bad attempt at mimicking discord. the layout is packed full of nothing. one panel leads to endless extravaganza another leads to some static screens. theres a fifty fifty percent chance of your phone number and even login correctly recognized. why..,0
I can't even use the app at all it sucks,0

This is amazing but it's not like Google meet and it's not joining But the Wi-Fi is 1000 load whats going on in this app,0

Dear google meet I have no issue with meet but can you add that is Mobile phone also we can change our background or blurr and raise hand feature also plz we are only able to change our background in laptop only so plz update it,1
"Frankly, using this Webex app results in a mediocre virtual meeting experience. I find controlling what you want to share challenging as I can only share my screen and not a specific application like you can in ZOOM. Also, the application is geared more towards Android phones and not as effective for use on Chromebooks. I have yet to figure out how to chat with an individual rather than the entire group. Overall, this app is disappointing but tolerable.",1
It works well. Sound quality for one person was bad and that was probably because of a bad connection. If yall could prioritize sound quality over video that'd be cool.,2
When I came back from meeting then spaeker is off please improve this,0
Background changed,0
Is not possible to simply disable notifications. The only solution is to uninstall the app.,0

Easy to use.,1
"The only problem I have is when I have appointments with my doctor and want to schedule or setup my next appointment, it sends me to my calendar and has me make it on my Google calendar. But it doesn't show up in the app. So the option to use this it's pointless. I can mark my appointment on the calendar myself. I figured I could setup appointments and I would be prompt to the meeting room with my doctor.",1
"I am facing a lot of issues from starting but uts not solved till now, many times showing connecting to a meeting but after that it's not connecting and showing up error , really disappointed",0

Good,1
Great user exprience,1
Good but the same to me,0
The update makes it more confusing. When a meeting going on and turn on full screen It's showing the owner's icon largely and prevent you to see full screen presentation. What is this? Meet's devs are really thinking it is usefull to see icons of myself when a full screen presentation going on! Please fix this issue. People nowadays depends on online class and meetings. That's why your competitors are getting popular when I think it should be reverse when meet released.,0

Sat on phone for a long while!!,1
"Updated review: The app is good, but the new interface layout is irritating. When someone shares the their screen/presentation, we cant see the presentation properly in full screen, because a small box is overlaid. Even if our camera and mic is off, still the box showing our profile pic shows up. This is really irritating, as we miss parts of the presentations. Like the desktop version, if we have an option to add our box into the existing layout boxes, instead of popping out then it would have been good and more user friendly.",1
When meeting this app a black screen when I use another app,0

It pauses and freezes on laptop and smartphone,0

Can't get it to work on the latest version of Android. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling. Desktop version sound quality is poor.,0
"App was easy to install and navigate. Liked the 4-panel screen view to see speakers, participant and screen share. As well, have the focus on screen share and speaker only. Wondered how to take screen shots for reference later.",2
You should add background settings for oppo or Vivo phones it will be better for all of us,1

"I think it's great that i can remain connected to the members of the corporation through this app, from as little as a quick text, to a conference call, even with video. And, with the click of a button, i can share my screen to all the members invited to the call. And, i can do this remotely. I can take part in this call from anywhere..be it from my desktop, laptop, or on my cell. And it doesn't stop there. One of the most used tools is the ability to jump on a live Excel spreadsheet.",2
Not able to install in window7..error keeps coming,0
I love it🥰🥰💝💝,2
It's very very very very very good app,2
"1) Needs a Help/tutorial feature. I can't figure out how to add people to a group.  2) I don't like how it had to sync my whole contacts list into the app. I have a bunch with no phone numbers, making it a waste of time to scroll through. Take a look at Skype. You can pull people up from your list without putting contacts in their app.    3) Option to list contacts by last name.   Neat but not doable for me as can't call w/Skype (Google Voice counts against my minutes).",0
Very good App. I love it,2
Very bad quality of sound. Very patchy access options. significant lag in actions even with a high speed broadband.,0
Clear audio output. The visual output could be improved.,2
Good,1
"As its name say, used for video meeting , simple and features rich app Good performance but takes a lot of time to load",2
Agree with below sentiments.   Used to be awesome but has fallen off in recent months.   Cannot create new calls or create new contacts which was 99% of the reason I used the app.,0

Our school is thinking to switch from GTM to teams please enable the options that teams have so our school will not switch to teams our school is having many branches so all students from the school will delete the app and your downloads will reduce so please enable the all options of teams in gotomeeting in 2 weeks.,0

still needs to improve,1
"Its an exellent app and is a boon during pandemic. I am not fortunately facing it now but an year or 5-6 months ago, it showed up a message of 'aw snap.' I thought it was normal for a computer to have a glitch once in a blue moon but the frequency kept on increasing until it reached its limit. Evertime I joined the meeting, this message didn't let me study. It went on its own but reason or suggestion by the team would be appreciated. Thank you",2
My good,1
This is a good ideal solution for video chat app,2
"Always beneficial. I use zoom often for church meetings, prayer, etc. A wonderful way to stay connected",2
How to add background image Google LLC❓Please tell me.Otherwise everything is just wow.,2
It is a good app that does plenty more than just for messages and video conferences. The drawback I see is that it balloons to need about 1.5GB of internal memory. It cannot be pushed out to an external SD card.,2
"Very bad app, 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪",0
Took a minute to get,2
"First time using the app. Only 3 people but sound was clear, easy to get into the meeting pretty good. I think it will stay on my mobile now.",2
Audio mode should stay the same after a phone call or other interruption of the audio stream. I find myself having to disconnect and then reconnect just to get it back to speakerphone.,2
"It's a great messenger app, enables live collaboration of docs and spreadshees and I love being able to edit messages after they've been sent. Video and audio calls work great too.",2
Nice App,2
"Would give more stars if everytime someone else that was a part of the group made a sound, such as their dog barking it switched to them, it made it almost impossible to get to watch while my daughter was the one getting her certificate. Very big disappointment. Although I believe it was mostly disrespectful of the other parent to not have muted their feed. I think that there should be an option to only view one particular feed instead of the one making the most noise at the time.",0

"This app is good for chats and class too ,but after every class it says rate us it which is worst thing .It hangs a lot",1

"December 26,2015.",1
I don 't know for wille,1
"Works fine on fast machines, computers can handle Teams easily but phones or even slow computers take a long time to do simple tasks, sometimes there are updates that somehow slow machines even more than usual, instead of new interfaces and stuff i would like updates dedicated to optimizing the app in both PCs and phones. Even with those problems, Teams works fine.",2
The mic system does not work properly. I speak on the mic but the listener gets very low voice of mine though I speak with full efforts then also the voice heard is very low.,0
I like it,2
good app but i can bigger my video and not easy to learn the controls,2
Meeting toolbar can now be made visible at all times on Android.,0
This is a very interesting tool. Easy to use and access meetings as scheduled. I encourage all people to learnbhow to use such a tool to make gains on time and maximise on technological innovations to deliver on their services.,2
Worked great for 2 weeks. I was able to save live stream after I its ended at 720p from my Samsung s10 now the app always crashes and I can't save the file right after the live stream ends anymore. It downgrades the file to 360p which looks awful compared to the live stream.,1
It is a great app. I am having an awesome experience with this app. Everything works perfectly .,2
Best,1

It's a very good app yet the voice is not clear if it had personal chat box it would have been better,2
"Zoom has been a real enabler during the pandemic. I have been able to continue many essential activities with work, family & friends. The features continue to improve. The best improvement is the ability to move seamlessly between devices & locations: phone>tablet, tablet>laptop & thus office to home to car and vice versa. I'd like to have the choice to put my most used features on the home screen, much like most mobile device options to put apps on the home screen.",2

This is a nice app but it takes too much net.and when I signed up with my name then after some time it changes my name automatically with profile.Firstly I thought that this app needs update but i saw in play store and i came to know that it doesnot needs update. But after a while it is working in a better way than that of before☺So i am rating 3 stars⭐⭐⭐,1

Awsm app for every employee,2
Love it!! Being able to access trainings on the go and remotely has been a huge boost to my business!!,2
I am not happy with the fact that it doesn't allow more than 10 people at a time to get on. I'm always getting complaints from people receiving an error message that says conference call is full when there is less than 10 people on. Other than that the quality isn't too bad!,1
Hmmmm ok👍,2
"Just like MS Teams and Google Meet, Zoom is also a good meeting platform for online classes, but can I have the picture-in-picture mini meet so that while I'm using other apps, I could see the person speaking or sharing the screen, and even unmute, open the camera or view the meeting in full screen, and to make the app more convenient than before. Thank you =]",2

Video quality is good but audio got cut off here and there.,0
"Have used this app with only workable issues for at least a year. However recently I encountered a more serious issue.  Seemingly suddenly during conference calls my mute button began failing. Initially I thought my phone had failed but I continued to have the issue after purchasing a new phone. After doing some troubleshooting I was able to confirm that this app caused the problem. I have since uninstalled the app (a problem because I have multiple conferences a day) and resumed using my mute button on my old phone with zero issues. I need this corrected ASAP that I can resume using the APP with my calls. This is a serious problem and major issues and I believe it began with the update that was completed on Oct 13, 2017.  Update 12/1/17 I reinstalled the app on  my Honor 6 phone with no issues but on a galaxy note 8 I still have the problem.",0

This a nice app i use this for meetings and my son use for classes but the reason i gave 3 star is when my sons online exam was going on google forms my son copy link and paste it in google it start and zoom automatically closes his teacher shout at him why you got out of class,1

Must use if you have conference calls.,2

"Generally easy to use. However, it lost a star for the mute button. The button is either orange or grey with the same symbol, the meeting starts off with no video or audio, and there was a delay when changing it. So my first meet was a little difficult. Hard to tell when I was muted or not. I would recommend starting with both on or at least starting with audio on have the icon image change from being crossed out to not crossed out when it's on. Also no web browser option for mobile devices.",2

I scheduled the call literally moments from the time I typed in the last participant's name, and there was no problem at all getting everyone on the line by the scheduled call time - two minutes later! The clarity of the conversation among the six of us was excellent, and everyone on the line commented on how easy UberConference had made it to join the conversation. My highest praise and thanks to this fabulous app!",2

This is the most useless app i have ever used. If there would be 0 star rating option i will give it 0 because it takes a lot of data but i always got disconnected while joining class and it always gives useless updates which also takes a lot of data. I would request all of you to not download this app.,0
Was a little laggy in terms of video and audio,1
Nice usefull app,2

You can't delete something you uploaded from the mobile app. The whiteboard isn't very practical. It would have been nice if there was a toolbar floating which would allow you to use it while you present any documents. Also there is no option of taking screenshots.,1

"Since the layout changed, the sound has improved . I am Satisfied with that but one thing that gets me off is that the presentation couldn't be heard. When the teacher tries to show a video or anything we can't hear anything usually. I wish the mobile version has some features of the web version as its more convinient. In play store it is said that "" raise a hand "" is there but I update everytime and couldn't get it. It will also be good if blur background was there .",1
Google meet should add 2 option create a meeting and join a meeting. Last time i was not able to join class because Everytime i type the class code and join it will join in different class code please help us in this one.,1

Our company uses this app all of the time and for the most part it has been very dependable for the past 2 years. There have been some minor issues That we have encountered but they were usually after a recent update of the app and life size was quick to fix the problem once we notified them. I'm giving you 5 stars.... So next year when we re-up on our contract think about giving us a discount.... Lol! Jk jk jk,2

If there must be chat option through which we can only privately chat with the organisers. NO CHAT OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO CHAT WITH FRIENDS. Through this if we know the name of the student who are repeatedly disturbing the class we can send the names private ly to the organisers and can settle the issue.,0

It took a while to get into the meeting even though I was there on the page they could not hear me that was a waste of 10 to 15 minutes the speaker needs to be recalibrated so that we can clearly hear and understand as each person is speaking with more clarity it took a while for us to get acclimated to the page but we got there.,0
Not bad but needs more features,2

"There should be an option to disable entry and exit tones just for yourself, even if you are not the host. An option which is currently unavailable. In meetings with 100+ participants, it is both distracting and annoying to be notified each time a participant enters or leaves the meeting.",1
It sucks,0
Very Very Badddddd,2
"Much has improved since the last version and the app is almost bearable now. Still it doesn't sync conversations and their status between desktop and mobile. Missed or dud notifications, lost conversations. A lesser evil to have it but there's room for improvement.",1

Nice,2
"After an update, there are many problems, I can't use it, however my internet condition is very okay..bruhh",0

To view screen thats being shared doesnt work,1
Good until I lost connection and couldn't get back in without finding someone else in the group to text the leader and have them open access back up,2
I have like to give 5 star but l won't give because my audio is not hearing for no one in some time and the presentation is very blurry and no one can hear my voicemail also,1
"Since the latest update, while start typing... I cannot see what I am typing means that writing area is hidden under the keyboard. Please fix it.. it's very inconvenient. Else teams is very good.",1
I started using it ever since i open up the orphanage (world's Mercy orphanage community Uganda) to speak to our donars abroad. And I have no problem with it because we can communicate very well thank you for the application it has also been part of the Charity compaign. Thanks,2
"Teams is good when use at org level but still has lot to improve, call quality and network bandwidth related issues are there.",1
Good thanks google team 😘😘😘😘,2
I'm Really Enjoying interacting with everyone & learning. The meetings are The Highlight of My Day + My son is a meeting instructor. I feel very blessed to be able to see him at work & helping his students. This app has truly been a gift for all. Thank You So Much,2
Great and easy app to use. Allows me to have everything I need at my fingertips for when I'm on the go or traveling and still need to reach or stay connected with work,2

"Argh, the app kept closing video, when I clicked to restored video, the mute button would come on. I gave up on video and just used the audio... After which, there were weird audio feedback issues. The entire thing was frustrating. 🙄",0
I am not having raising hand option please do something about it And joining and lefting notification trouble me as it covers the mic button as well as camera button if there mam is asking me i could not just remove that permanently. please give option of off notification in the settings of meet And if this things fixes i will thing this is best app please kindly give action on my feedback,0

Nice🤩 app but it takes so many time to start the meet i always shows connecting..............😟,2

Good app for students and teachers. New features are very good like search someone in meeting and raising hand icon and other also. But in fist version was not much good but new version is very good. So ok please send new version or update which is having recording a meeting and others.,2
I'm rating only 3 stars because in many devices virtual background is not there that's why I am rating it only 3 stars if you add virtual background option in everyone's device then I will rate it 5 stars and I don't like this app that much because virtual background option not given and sometimes it will be disconnect when the internet connection is very good also😒 when you people will add virtual background option in everyone's device I wanna rate it 5 stars,1
Can you add a function to hide my own icon? It's blocking my view to the presenter. Especially when the box is so damn big. I already sent this issue to you before.,0
"Initially was difficult to log in , but got better it. Good mode for larger group audience .",2
I can't use the leave call Camera Mic buttons Nothing is working Everything just goes blank whenever i press the back button,0
"When I temporarily lose my internet connection, like when I'm traveling down the highway, and the connection is regained and is stable, this app says that I have rejoined the meeting and I can see everyone but no one can hear me and I can't hear anyone even if I switch audio devices. To get audio working again, I have to reboot my phone and rejoin the meeting. I don't have this problem with WebEx, zoom, or with regular phone calls.",1
"I use Zoom for a variety of reasons/settings/types of meetings. Overall, I think Zoom works well but I have noticed some things that maybe could use improvement but I'm not sure if they are caused on Zoom's 'end' or not.",2
I do zoom raids,2
Na,2
I would only like to say that this app have that showing video in gallery after update it changes and I don't like it because we can't see the full video so please make it like before,1
"This is best app for video meeting but, it uses a lot of internet.In mobile there is no options for suitable audio and video preferences",1
The chat threads keep on disappearing after the update. You can read the message send by other as it disappears. Microsoft Team should look into this problem seriously.,0
I fell it super good because of this app my daughter 's online classes go on.,2

Poor app,0
"Mostly easy. Was able to learn it after maybe the second try. I like it for professional settings. *Edit* I have updated to the new version and I like it. It let's you know when you have mutated yourself so incase you need help reminding yourself that you're muted, it shows you directly on to your image when you try to speak.",2

I have many apps, that is the same on both phone and tablet. Why can't I download the zoom app on my tablet? An edit: I finally was able to download zoom on my tablet. Done. I love to be able to utilize zoom, anywhere and at any time. Just great 👍",2
I'm only giving one star because it's has no camera quality and my video is so blurry. I can't change my background but others can. I have no ✨ this button below to my video but others have.,0

"Had no audio and couldn't figure out how ro turn it on, I was in an important training. All I could do was read the power point. Not user friendly. This is the 4th or 5th app like this that I've been forced to use. I'm sure it was something in the settings just couldn't find it. I can't figure out how to be moe specific, I didn't have audio, couldn't find a button or any help about how ro turn it on. It wasn't about internet connection it was zero audio. I had to do some training, missed it.",0
"Facing the issue, Sorry this chat does't exist anymore.",0

Good But Not Very Good,1
The app is very good. I would love to have a feature that shows whether it is a problem with my connection or the person on the other side because of which the voice or video is breaking. There should be something like a small indicator that shows whether you internet is slow,2
Voice break and reconnecting issue in mostly time in meeting is very bad please this issue .,0
Doesn't allow to join existing meeting by URL on android device. it should automatically redirect to meeting room.,0

Excellent,2
A great app the audio is good but When a bunch of people talk the audio is not that good The video is okay I would say great but if it didn't lock up your camera this would be a 5 star rating app,2
Sometimes it sounds robotic n no connection but otherwise I like it,2

St of,2
"I have only one issue. That is , my mobile just gets switched off if I turn on the camera. Like it's so irritating. Because the staffs won't understand what I say and they just get mad at me for not being there inside the class. Why does it give up like that when I turn on my camera? It doesn't even last for 5 minutes. My phone keeps restarting and it's annoying.",0

"A few complications, but overall pretty good.",2

Good experience fantastic app,1
It runs on its own after downloading . But I went to see if there was a way to test sound etc.. also while looking up other things I wanted to know if there was video and audio settings. The help page said in the upper right hand corner and listed settings available. I am running a Note 20. These settings don't show on the screen like it claims. If I am missing something I would like to know where the menu is for the settings in call or not in call. Please don't ask me to submit a ticket.,1
"When connected through cell network, a temporary drop in the connection causes meeting to be lost. It never reconnects for remainder of meeting. Works fine with Wifi.",1

Because I am using for class sometimes it will not show video of others and sometimes I left class without my permission so it is not good for meeting but for friends or family members meets it is good and I want to tell them that see there are some technical problem in your app so see that and there are many ads also. And also I can't raise my hand in meetings .,1

There should be a lock button for mic and camera. Sometimes being embarrassed if the camera or mic is opened by mistake.,2

Why can't I see effect option in meet,1
First time using this program so I'm not really sure so I gave 3 stars because the video kept freezing. It could have been a internet connection or it could be that to many people are using this program during the same time as my internet company has said... Not sure.,1
worked fine until the recent update now the app will not open or log in and is in a never ending cycle of opening and closing itsself. Hadti uninstall it. Will have to fond other way to communicate at work,0

"Team Google Meet, We use the Samsung A 7 tab for online classes of my son. After using the Google meet app for hardly 10 times, this issue has raised and hasn't resolved till date. Issue: When my son unmutes Google meet to answer in the online class, the voices of teachers and other members starts to echo badly, and my son is asked to mute immediately. There is no other device being used around him. Both microphone and camera is enabled and allowed for use in the app. No issue from Samsung.",0

"Video is fuzzy and audio is a bit delayed. My main complaint is that I cannot see more than 3 participants, besides myself, on screen, at any time, nor can I easily change their order. This despite having 4-7 other participants online. Disappointing and frustrating. Wish my moderator would use Zoom instead. 3 months on and no improvement.. in fact, all of the above complaints have gotten worse... Hating this app.",0
Used to work fine. Now it repeatedly tells me I don't have an account. Only the mobile app does this. I have to reinstall it EVERY TIME I want to use it. Garbage.,0

Great so far,2
"I have only one issue. That is , my mobile just gets switched off if I turn on the camera. Like it's so irritating. Because the staffs won't understand what I say and they just get mad at me for not being there inside the class. Why does it give up like that when I turn on my camera? It doesn't even last for 5 minutes. My phone keeps restarting and it's annoying.",0

Zoom is good but there are times when it crashes and I get upset because I'm in an important meeting that's why I gave it a four-star I feel like giving it three stars but for the most part other than when zoom is crashing it's good so I'll leave it at four stars.,2

While screen sharing is done - It gets very small for the viewers. Can the tech team work on it please and give us options to see the presenters screen in full size. Second issue is - people who aren't invited can also join through the link and it's a confidential issue if the audience is large and we can't control an outsider for that matter. Third is a request - Should allow an option to access anybody's screen and type it after allowing the option,1

And the updated version has made more easier to use it 😀. I always use it to attend my meetings. But I had a problem with this! Many people have rate with 1⭐ and that's my problem 😕, All need to rate this 5⭐. So thanks to webex terms 🥰🥰.",2

Slow and choppy,0
Good but one major bug is if you leave a place and an account is no longer valid you can't just remove it. It keeps asking you to log on. You have to uninstall then add back other accounts. Very annoying.,1

"First;, Why doesn't the app have chat open on the right and visible? Second; why won't the application actually close? Audio stays connected after closing. Third; I entered the meeting number and I still need to enter a password... What is this verification baloney that has recently been added on? Fourth; Crashes... So much fun when you have to re-enter all of the previous info to get back in. It gets 2 stars for video. Otherwise, this is a dismal failure of an app.",0

Free Facebook page,2
Probably one of the most annoying apps ever. Don't use this app for both work and personal use bc toggling between the two accounts causes errors and it looks like YOU accidentally deleted a group chat or Teams channel. It also prompted in a way that looked like I couldn't post or message anything. I like to work efficiently and this app just won't cut it.,0

"It was going good for 2 years, there were small audio problems but they weren't too bad. Today however my friends and I joined the usual meet we would join with the same code and the meet ended after an hour and we can no longer use the code we've been using for about a year now. And now we can only call for an hour at a time before having to make a new code. We absolutely hate it and it's less affective now. Moving to zoom.",0

If I just start using it after updating it, IT DOESN'T EVEN OPEN. NOT EVEN THE MAIN SCREEN APPEARS. It's so much trouble. It crashes every other time.

I have little or no problems while using this app. We use ii every day for Conference call at work.

Keeps lagging all the time during the meeting even if it is updated😑,0
It's a great app for my studies but the only reason I am giving 3 stars is because when I don't have wifi it uses a lot of data .... Like for a 40 minutes meeting it uses my 800 mb data and it gets very annoying,1

This is so amazing app for my class,2
i miss a lot of messages sent to me because app won't show notifications. i literally got chat notifications late over 24 hours. this app can get you fired.,0
Hard to hear on any device,0
The app works similar to the PC version which is good. It makes the learning curve easier. Teams has never been the most intuitive interface. The Android Auto component is very disappointing. I am now having to disconnect Android Auto to attend meetings on the move,1
Constantly opening when not using it,0

Sound from someone else's screen share stops if I turn off my screen or even go into a zoom menu. I need to use dial in audio to work around this.,1
Very simple to get into but pretty basic. Doesn't work with my Bluetooth headset,1

Great experience and easy to access. Thank you WebEx!,2
That is a very good app for online classes,2
"Pretty buggy on Pixel 3 XL. Logs out constantly and reloads multiple times trying to come back in. Ultimately I still need to sign back in each time I open it. I'd say this happens 85% of the time. Not only this but the core reason I try and use this app is to chat with people, it's also a pretty bad, slow and laggy experience. I have a top tier phone and cannot believe how much it lacks in a chat experience to Slack, Discord and others.",0
Very good,2
Starting this app is working perfectly but after previous update there were so many problems for joining meetings.,1
Useless mostly unavailable when need to join a call.,0
"I like this app 🥰.but there was a problem i updated this very time and uninstall , install very time but i didn't get filters😭.Please solve it.",1

What can this app do that the standard Facebook app can't ?,0
I first downloaded the app 01/20/21 and it was confusing,0
"We faded out and rotated positions even though we had 4 slots available on by phone. Three of us were on video and 3 were audio only. I could not transfer to my iPad. DATA came up but no link. Who knows, it all new for some of us. Thank, nevertheless",1
Great,2
It was easy,2
Good app,1
"terrific method for maintaining and generating team engagement, recognition and communication.",2
"Great work guys, keep it up!",2
When network issues happen this app totally hang. Video struck and no audio even joining as an attendee. Very pathetic.,0
"It would have been a five (star) except the app has redirected my account to another device and does not allow me to use the app on the device that I initially used to set up the app. Furthermore, the app has redirected the meetings that were set up on the original device to this, a subsequent device.",2
"In this update i cant open the reference materials and it is a major problem because i cant finish my assignments and activities, i hope this problem can be fixed until sunday so that we can finish on time.",0
"Can't zoom in on mobile. Just turns on the face sensor and screen mutes. Android programers provide better content than Microsoft yet again. Heard of test cases? Might want to try your products out before releasing them on random platforms. I literally have Google's flagship pixel phone and they messed it up, blatantly. Luckily for MS, workers are stuck with office products.",0
Too slow.. Maybe early beta days still?,0
Great app just when my teachers assign homework I can't access the documents in the assignment,2
Eclent,2
So good,2
I have never seen this before its very nice and easy,2
Great virtual conference tool! I had some issues with figuring out how to put in the meeting ID and pass code but finally figured out a way to get into the meeting. I think having a way to join a meeting in the Meetings tab would be great. I haven't tinkered with the app much so maybe I'm just missing it.,2
Good,2
good And easy to handle,2
"Please, add option for background. It seems that it will only applicable when you use it through google chrome/ desktop site not on the exact app. Thanks",1
The audio was very poor and I couldn't participate in the polls,1

"Great app... it's free, easy to use, video and audio options, and a great way to communicate and attend meetings/class's in this new time of tele-health and social distancing. The only issue is if too many people in meeting/class have their mic on at the same time... there is interference. Kind of annoying to mute and un-mute during the interaction... but like I said, it's free and easy to use so it's I minor inconvenience. Recommend to anyone needing to meet up without contact!!",2
Thanks,1
"Much has improved since the last version and the app is almost bearable now. Still it doesn't sync conversations and their status between desktop and mobile. Missed or dud notifications, lost conversations. A lesser evil to have it but there's room for improvement.",1
Too slow. Not working app please don't install,0
"Love this app, I get all my meeting and court hearing done on zoom. Awesome app",2
The app has improved a lot during recent updates. It is a lot more stable. There have also been usability improvements. I would say that it is very user-friendly and stable.,2
Nice app,2

Keep getting the messesge to identify my identty which is super frustrating. Ill rate 5 ★ when i get my account back. WhatEva :/",0
I liked the previous version better for mobile. The screen for seeing who was on the call was better and it was easier to shut off the speaker. I'm not always somewhere where using the speaker is appropriate and I need to have a control on the main screen that easily switches the speaker on/off.,1
My audio not audible to meeting organizor,0
Very nice and easy to use app we can connect while on roaming and can be part of any important organisation meeting and save time need not be on desk always must have good supportive internet connection.,2
Works mostly but does seem to malfunction as soon as any other application on the device requests to use the microphone. I usually need to relaunch teams to fix the issue,1
"i really enjoy using ms teams sooo convenient, but, why there's no background option in android mobile version.",2
I can't open any files in my assignment tab!,1

GOOD,0
It is fairly easy to use and better laid out than other apps such as Google classroom,2
When I want to send a message the osk opens up and completely covers the typing area so I have to input blindly. If I minimize the keyboard then open it back up again the typing area will then scroll up to be visible above the osk.,1
"It literally works on anything, from phones to Chromebooks. Use this app every day for work, and can't recommend it highly enough.",2
"It's good app, but the update now. I don't like it. It didn't show the floating anymore when im searching in Google and trying to open my album. I hope they will fix it as soon as possible.",1
Cannot join a conference call I am invited to without signing up for an account. Zoom allows you to do that.,0
Can't download/upload attachments after the recent update. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but didn't work.,0

Its a very very usefull app nowadays because we currently take online clasess and it is a lint- free app that is very very easy to use so i recommend you guys to download if you want your zooming experience to be more succesfull:),2
This was beneficial. I wasn't able to attend the hearing due to covid. Great sound and video conference. Excellent app!,2
When I close my zoom when doing meeting it automatically leave from meeting and can't play game. When doing meeting 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂,1
I cant raise hand and i cant open the cam while opening other app,1
Hey Google please see to this problem!...when meet is in window mode during a class and I want to change its position from one place to other...it fall down to the cross and disables itself automatically...please resolve this problem...that window mode is very convinient...and it's very annoying to see all this.,1

Good,2
This is a very helpful app for students. But I have one problem I was using this app in PIP (picture in picture) Mode but by mistake I off this mode so how can I on this mode again. Reply Me Please.,2
Profiles won't load properly and app keeps crashing. Great app when it actually works but as it sits right now I basically can't even use it. Please fix!,0
Please put a double tap option on the screen through which we can forward the recorded videos by 10 seconds whenever we want... Just like YouTube.,1

Zoom is the best since slice bread!!!! Just don't like how it is extremely hard for me to use it with my phone. Find it hard to change photo and background pics,2

I love zoom you can speak to your friends and love ones all schedule a meeting for schools etc...,2
My good,1
It was good until I can't open any assignments for school such as pdf's I don't know if it's me but that's my problem with it,1

"Convenience, ease, awareness of colleagues' availability. True MSFT 'suite' product that seamlessly works with many other products easily. Sound quality is great, especially with Poly gear.",2
It is taking net fast and video is no t clear,1

"Could not turn the volume up loud enough to hear the speaker. In Addition, it wouldn't load on my laptop which I preferred.",1
Good,2
Easy to use,1
"Great app. I use it for work and overall it works well, the one big flaw I see in this app is the lack of organization options for my chats. I wish we had folders or something similar, only being to pin chats isn't enough.",2
Nice for meeting,0
The app is easy to use but sometimes a bit confusing in mobile for. the ads this app is really nice.,1
Very very bad app. It's not downloading since 1hour before joining a meeting. Its written here as pending. Solve the issue team.,0
Excellent source of communication in these times.,2
Very naice,2
Hangs a lot. Sometimes it doesn't take input while typing. Very unresponsive app.,0
Login was confused but did ok,2
Was so excited to use the app.. but first thing upon signing up for it is a warning that I have to upgrade it to business level if I want a Canadian conference call number. I feel duped. If you're only going to be free in the US from the US that's fine but then say it up front not only telling us after we've downloaded the app,0
"Would like to know if the app already has the option to increase playback speed of the videos, if not please add that . Thanks",2
The update is very bad and when we open the chat box the camera automatically turns off and same with the meeting information pls give the old version back 🙏🙏🙏🙏,2
After the new update the screen sharing camera gives troubles. When i pause the camera and start the resume the children complain that they cant see the screen.,1
very nice,0
More data consuming then other video call apps,0
"great app for my online classses but there's one thing that keeps bugging me. Whenever i try to press homescreen, it just shows black background and when i press the 'back to the room' something button, i cant press any of the buttons below",1
Good.,1
Does it consume more data,1
"Good sound and visuals. Platform could be more facilitator-friendly because presenters often cannot figure out how to show their screens, which creates down time and frustrations.",2
Work very nicely I like this app,1
عالیه,1
I have to use this app for my group therapy and doctors appoinments ive had several issues with dropped calls but i understand it happends and that wouldnt have bothered me if it was just that. Recently it has begun to not even allow me in my group despite full bars on my phone. If it continues after i update i will try to reinstall but i will also drop a star. If it fixes my issues i will give a higher score.,0
"Works mostly, but whenever I try to screenshare on the newest version of Android it won't let me switch to another screen. Makes it impossible to demo apps to potential customers",1

Pop up of participant joined meeting and left meeting is very irritating.... Soch popup stops the access to other options Change the location of such popup.,1
Nice app,2
Now the app works really well. Perfect when you need to be on two devices and running around while still in the meeting. Also settings are OK to find and use.,2
It is really good kinda fun but not really i dont really like online school i like the school-school better also can you please make androids be able to put the backgrounds and other stuff too,1

"Great app, several options to connect with the team. I just wish it was more reliable, it has improved but there's still room for improvement.",2
It doesn't show pop up notifications. Only when i open the app i get notifications,0
It makes the mobile much slower and hangs much. My voice doesn't connect automatically.,0
Push notifications don't work - so i never know what is going on and miss communications,0
Make it user friendly,2
Uneven. So good to have this remote option but video cut out several times. Bandwidth limits participation.,1
"Absolute non sense they are limiting meeting for only to 45 mins for a free version , i felt using skype & zoom meetings are far more better than this",0
The meetings I have attended have been a success. They are easy to join and participate in. Thank you.,2
I am giving 5 start bacause it is very nice app for meating but the problem is we are not able to put the virtual background please fix it..,2
"They've added a new feature of pop up window now. This latest update has made it annoying. Because whenever i enlarge the pop up form to full screen, video becomes dark. I mean the video that I've pinned just disappears. I can't see anything. I thought it was for a short period of time, i waited about a minute and it was still dark.",2
Never used it before having to for school. Seems really neat and works well so far. Helps make contacting professors A LOT easier,2

"It doesn't notify you of new post, comments, or likes. Not worth paying for it.",0
Nice application,2
Good,2
"Worst meeting application it always saws the error ""another app is using audio pls try later""",0
Quite often out of sync with desktop application. Especially with unread markers which annoys me quite a lot as I start to read stuff and realize I go through a second time. As a general optimization: I'd like to have a notification booster for specific channels which are close to sms ring tones. So the ability to send important messages to channels manually tor by API would be great,1
"Good, but at times, voice was lost.",2
Excellent,2
"i use this app routinely and generally like it. my company doesnt use Webex, but one of our partners does. when i join from my phone app i never have issues. i can talk amd listen, see any presented material, and even use my camera as a webcam for video calls. it works fine over LTE even while driving. i cant rate it 5 stars as i have not used it to host as my company doesnt use it. but as an outside client i generally like it.",2

"Microsoft Teams is an incentive and groundbreaking app in the education world. When covid hit Microsoft made sure we as students had every opportunity to continue our learning. A few of my favorite perks of Microsoft Teams is the transcript option! I mean come on, yes! Some of my teachers talk extremely fast but thr transcripts words have me stay on track. I also like that you can use the app just for family. My parents are NOT tech savy but Microsoft created an app that can be easily taught.",2
"Amazing application. No issues on a decent wifi connection. Video nice and clear, no dropouts or micro lags. Audio sounded better than most cellular phone calls.",2

Battery consumption is too high. Ill recommend to use mic only when its turned on by clicking mic.,1
"I've had better web meeting experiences. Not sure if it was due to multiple people in the meeting or poor connection on either side but there was quite a delay, great difficulty having all participants on at once and audio quality made it difficult to understand participants.

Outstanding App,2
Nice,0
cant use,0
"No way to move to horizontal mode like zoom , My pc was shuttring when sharing screen although the pc is quite powerful",0
hey google i want to tell you that you should add an option of sending messages in call messages section so that if the video is blur so we can share pictures to understand properly during online classes,2
"Finally the UI is optimised for Android tablets! Much nicer to use now. It would be much nicer if the chat doesn't open in full-screen but on the side or in a small pop-up, so it's possible to type in the chat while watching/video-conferencing.",2
Excellent view and clear and good audio. Some trouble getting on but manage to log on the WebEx.,2
I cant change my background Pls fix it While camera is on so i cant have any option for virtual background Why is this so Pls fix it!😡,0
Worst app ever. Volume level is so low... But the main thing is that we have to use it. Stupid noice reduction,0
It was working fine...but nowadays the vedio and audio is not syncing..please solve this,0
Wonderfull,2
Had some breakup a few times during the hour....maybe an issue at my end,2
"Please put spotlight to everyone even in free zoom apps, and allow greenscreen in free apps because i use this apps for online class. One morething i want to say is that this apps take to much net, if they solve this three thing i will give 5 star and good comment 1. Allow Greenscreen background in free apps 2. Allow spotlight to everyone in free apps 3. It took much internet",1
Love this app,2
Good,2
Don't disconnect if you have unanswered questions. Can't get it back. Otherwise I would give 5 stars.,2
It's not working properly. All the features are not working. When I first started everything was working Great. The app keeps stopping.  It keeps coming up invalid user,2
Very Very slow loading. And I get constantly notification: 'Are you still there?' while I am 2 minutes away from the tap. very irritating and refreshing,0
Vvv good,2
"Meet now feature got stuck on join had to force stop to actually join, camera didn't turn on, can't see multiple people at once. Canceled my subscription.",0
"Just held my first Uber conference call -- flawless.  Set up took 1 minute with a near-zero learning curve.  Free option gets 10 people on the call (all I needed).  You can add paid bells and whistles like toll free numbers and custom wait music, so it can adjust to any business's needs and tastes.  After my conference call I even received a summary of the participants and how long each person spoke.  Super cool.  If you like simple, effective solutions, you will love Uber.",2
Worst app I have seen in my life zero rating for this app it is getting logged out and I am not able to login in in this app worst app worst,0
There is a quick start guide that makes no sense. tried looking for help and found none,0
Teams is better,0
Best app,2
"With working remote, Teams is essential for building and maintaining strong work relationships.",2

IDK,1
Hello your app Is really good I love it but pls keep featurs in it like zoom keep like we can personally chat anyone in the meeting and more interesting features pls pls I request u,2
Good apps,2
It take lot of time to install,0
This is really good I don't see much problem in this app but it might be good idea if the control panel doesn't auto hide and only hide when pressed and that's why I gave it 4 stars but idk why everyone is giving it like 1start just because of that,2
This app has always been easy-to-use. I use it a coue tomes a month and have no problems.,2
"Usefully, but it's a major resource hog. The mobile and the desktop version are resource hogs. Teams regularly shows up if you run Android's system optimization as an app that it recommends you manually put it to sleep because it's killing the battery.",0
Not yet,1
Please also do the thing in the phone that the children can have the background effect so that the people who are not feeling comfortable to open the camera then they can open the camera.,2
I waited a long time then my removed,0
There is an issue with audio reception...audio fluctuations are frequent with low network signal (mobile data),2
1.No file can be downloaded from assignment section please check very glitchy in mobile device. Please check earlier it was download able but not now it is happening for 1 week.NO FILE IS DOWNlable 2.CONSUMES A LOT OF BATTERY AND DRAINS VERY FAST.,0
It's a good app but I do hope that the virtual background is enabled for all mobile phones,2
Nice app to connect people. If only there were no time limit,1
If recieved phone call while using zoom audio not working after call drop.,1
Good,1
"I'm getting no notification in my mobile. I have enabled all notification settings, battery optimization settings, data usage settings, enabled auto start. Still not getting any notifications.",0
excellent. great clarity in sound easy connection,2
It is nice. But the problem is that it doesn't have raise hand option.,2
Possible thank,2
Didn't work,0
𝔽𝕦𝕟,1
This is app is pretty good....but it can be better if you add the option to set the schedule of the meetings,2
Good app,0
It's an good app But of course there are some down sides to it like it log's out on its own and if you forget your password it's a pain to reset password There are some other stuff but other than that I would rate 7/10,2
"Always says ""unknown error occured"" deim",0
On desktop or laptop its fine but. It would be nice to have a pop up window or the ability to fade the chat on tablet or mobile. Other that so far good.,2
Wasn't able to use chat feature and the audio kept cutting out when I switched from one audio setting to another.,0
Good,1
Nice app,2
"It's all nice ! As you all know , when I share my screen and present audio , my audio is not shared . My device is Lenovo tab M10 . Pls .....try to fix this issue .",2
I am very happy with this app because of its easy communication features which greatly helps me and students of my school to grasp concepts taught by our teachers in online classes,2
Workplace app is very beautiful,2
"No lag, and i was able to zoom in on the fly to see fine detail being worked on by the organizer.",2
Good!,2
"I love MS Teams app! It's far better than Skype, GoToMeeting, and others I've used.",2
this app is great you can call your friends and do work meetings too. I'm downloading the update to seee if they fix bugs such as disconnecting and stuff. To sum it all up. This app is great and I'm exited for new update,2
Good,2
Super aap,2
"Great App for people who can't get out, scared to come out, or just not close to meetings.",2
Very good,2
As a participant how can I record meeting,1
Best ap for online e class picture quality is very bad therefore I given 3 stars,2
Happy with all aspects,2
Alright,2
Online exam,1
The app was having problems connecting and the audio cut out for a bit. I had to log out and login three times. Zoom is much easier to navigate and troubleshoot.,0
Great app with user friendly interface. My Mom could probably use it and she doesn't even know how to copy & paste things,2
"No stability issues for me, has a few visual bugs in the interface (e.g.: showing meetings as ongoing when they ended or the other way around). I have a powerful phone and some colleagues complain about stability and re-logins, I suspect that Teams background service is being killed by the OS as resources are needed. One thing that nags me most, and this happens in the desktop version (Linux/Mac version) as well, is the impossibility of scheduling (and checking upcoming) meetings through it.",1
This app has come a long way. I'm surprised it's so powerful. A great productivity tool. Android 11 realme the chat is lower than keyboard unless I set it to a very low height. No other app has this issue. Keyboard hangs over chat box making it impossible to see without lowering and raising keyboard. Very annoying.,2
Wonderful. Zoom is one of the best response to this pandemic. It brings people together and it is an awesome tool for education.,2
My first time to use it but it's easy to use and stable... Keep updating it as much as you can..thank you.,2
Great! Very useful to work and meetings in this time of pandemic..,2
The audio sometimes skips or cuts off. Sometimes there's also static but I'm not sure if it's from the app or from my cheap phone.,2
"It waste my time,so annoying...",0
Can u take the timer off of google meet its annoying because we have to wait a hour or something and then it says 10 minutes before the call ends can u do something about it please.,0
Excellent service and a great tool for distance business communication.,2
Out,1
Unable to connect to audio,0
I've only used for videoconferencing and it works well. I've had a good overall experience with conducting meetings with my staff.,2
Nice good,1
"Can't join rooms, just wants to create one all the time. The computer version of this works brilliantly but this app is awful. Not worth downloading.",0

"Quite good app. But I'm not sure about privecy. Please clear me one thing, can organiser of the meeting can see the personal chat between two attendies.",1
"01/07/20 Was great but now completely ruined by no longer being able to see only the presenter's screen. If you're participating in an online exercise class then you need this feature. Sure, the 6 screen view has it's uses but there was no need to remove the 1 screen option. Obviously the developers are oblivious to the needs of virtual exercising. Can I upgrade to the older version? 08/07/20 Presenter doesn't have option suggested by dev so I'm still stuffed. Why remove a feature?",0
Audio terrible,1
Nice,2
Great,2
"Ur app has lots of issues in vedio as well as audio, just fix them.",0
It's a good app but many glitch is going on,1
It is not useless but literally it sucks! First of all the voice of the presenter always has a tendency to crack and the video keeps freezing .It takes a good deal of time to unmute yourself and the video display is indeed not encouraging.Please fix these..........,0
no,0
Too many interruptions cant see or hear properly. Very poor.,0
I love it,2
"Unmute hardly shows up after several uninstalls and reinstalls. Yes, the app is current. Intermittent video. This us an important and required feature for some people, yet our complaints are not heard. Very frustrating when the other party hangs up, disconnects, because they don't know I'm there or still there, as they can't hear me. App does not alert either party if or when ""NOT CONNECTED."" Sad. App is SAD!",0
worst app for pc,0
Highly not recommended,0
"(Chromebook version) I will say that it's typically fine, but tonight I tried to log in to a meeting tonight and received ""zoom client must be upgraded to join this meeting"". I have no idea what this means and there's zero help to fix this issue on the website. I'm told we're on version 5.2 (as of 12/7/21) but mine is listed as 5.0.1 with no update option on the play store or website) Do they just not help chromebook users at zoom?",1

"I have a issue. My son used to do his school on the computer and everything was okay. But today I had a meeting so my son was going to use his phone. We have really good Internet but when he was joining the meeting, the meeting would last for less than 1 minute and then say Searching for network. So now I had to cancel my meeting so he could do his school. Pls fix this 🙏",0
Nice,2

Zoom is very good app,1

"Too many bugs... They say bugs are fixed when they update, but, the bugs are more when the app updates... Very disappointed.",0
"Great on my Android Phone but many of my employees who use iPhones don't get notifications alerts. This has to be fixed to make this a alternative then WhatsApp. If iPhone users have to do a workaround and adjust settings, then it's not ready for the masses yet.",2

Babar jatt,0
It was easy to use this application once I downloaded it. I haven't used it to initiate a meeting however. I'll reserve that review for the future.,2
Just have to try,1
"Overall does what it's supposed to, but the mobile interface seems lacking. For instance I joined the meeting before connecting my Bluetooth headset to my phone, and then had no option to get the sound into my headset without leaving the meeting oh, and I'm not even sure it would have work then. This is a basic functionality that any modern application should have. I think with some work it could be a great app but right now it seems like a product that was created to get something on the market.",1
Video quality is not good,0
"The app is really nice, still from a while my video is creating a scene, the prblm is that , whenever I switch my audio on for some time it goes all well but then after sometime my meeting get disconnected.... My network also can't be a problem as I have enough of data..",0
I cant connect with my wifi,0
the new update is scam.,0
It is good but I can't chat to everyone I can't make meeting but why I have already updated the app but now also I can't chat why I didn't know about this and there is not an option for send emoji It's mine problem ok.,2

My experience with the latest version is failures and restarts if I fold my device open or unfold it during a meeting I get booted for my meetings.

Very nice though I faced some voice problem during my meeting. But it's not the fault in app I think network issue caused it. All I can say about this app is that this app is best among the number of meet apps.,1

The new update for those using tablets is incredible. But one major problem is that the chat box still takes up the whole screen during the meeting.

"I actually preferred everything with the app but it's only unfortunately one couldn't record with phone. The record feature for phone should be made available for mobile too!!! Zoom its contemporary has it, developer should look into it",0
What a great App! Pinch to zoom on presentations is something super fancy. Never seen on video conferencing Apps.,2
"This app is pretty unreliable and lacking in features compared to competing products. Switching from 4G to WiFi, or WiFi to 4G will cause it to crash. Switching from speaker to Bluetooth will cause it to crash. Receiving a regular call (even if dismissed) while using the app will cause the app to crash. App does not support background operation or PiP mode, so you cannot multi task with this app - attempting to do anything else will cause your connection to close. There are no options for resizing or locking on participant feeds. There are no call quality adjustments. There is no way to start a call in audio only mode. There are numerous other missing features as well that are too long to list here that have been available in other conferencing options for quite some time. Overall, I use this app because I have to for work, but would not recommend it unless you are locked in to the Lifesize ecosystem.",0
Nothing To Do Something New! 😒,1

This is a terrible VC solution. Appalling quality and that is only IF you can get it to connect! Don't waste the ridiculous amount of money that this company charge.,0
Cuttings in between maybe it was connection problem. But otherwise when in order every word was clear.,1
Only video meeting app which does not run on Android 5.x on my tab. Had it not been corporate requirement I would have loved to ignore it for zoom. I cannot join via my tab which has way better camera and convenience for meetings. Now I have to forcefully join from a laptop which has not enough battery backup and a phone which has not good enough camera. This system requirement was not needed given everyother app still supports.,0
Well enough.,1

"I like using Zoom, very comfortable as a user. However I used to run my college classes on it, setting breakout rooms was a bit tricky in that situation. It runs best when there is someone in charge of the technical side as it's tricky to do it all at the same time. I wonder if there is a way to include making it more data friendly for those of us who watch our carbon footprint. I also occasionally have issues with internet, so need to resort to WhatsApp that consumes less data.",2

The voice was a little distorted, I couldn't understand everything. I will definitely use it again to make sure it was not of my doing. I did not try to mess with the volume or to remove one of the panes.",1

Awsome app for conference,2

GoToMeeting is excellent to use. No audio issues the way I have experienced with other services.,2
"Works most of the time but connecting still an issue. You will think in 2020 we would nail phone technology but 50% of the time when I press 1 to connect to my meeting, it doesnt work and Webex just hang in there. Maybe create a bigger easier button to have people on the road in mind...or voice activation...Again its 2020 not 1980, should be possible to do. Also I am missing the simple view for driving so I can unmute myself easily, or better use voice activation to Mute/Unmute.",1
A midget app if you ask me,1
"Easy to use, speakers were highlighted, can turn others on mute or turn there video of if needed.",2
I would like to give only 3 stars for rating because of the following reasons:- 1) This app hangs a lot in tabs.. 2) The app is very heavy and slows down the speed of mobile phone and with battery as well.. 3) But yes new features are coming up and I'm happy with it..Rest it works great compared to others.. ☆I HAVE WRITTEN THE REVIEW BASED ON MANY PEOPLE OPINION AND MINE AS WELL.. Thank you,1
I wish there was a setting where the app didn't log out ever. There is enough security with my phone login. Usually I need to use the app right when my conference is starting and then I have to fumble and login and make everyone wait.,2
And it's so easy,2
I could not hear anything from my headphones or speaker Google meet teams and zoom are a lot better,0

This app is too good for online meetings and seminars the reason behind i gave it only 3 stars instead of 5 us it has participants limit upto 100 it is humble request to zoom team that they should increase the participants limit.Thank You,1
This Meet app drains my phone battery quickly plus have a lot of camera issues in the desktop website version.Not as friendly & problem-free as Zoom Meetings.,0
"I don't even know why this exists if I'm being honest. It has had like a thousand different problmes since the day i had to download it. Currently references in assignments won't open like many people have already said. It's unusable at this point. I have about 7 assignments I need to do but I cant, since, you know... I don't know what the assignments are. Please fix it, as my school will be forcing me to use it for at least another year.",0

"I love all these Google applications I find it important that I point out all these critical issues that is making the app work badly • the chat- the chat has been lagging insanely and when I say insanely, sometimes when I join meetings and people are saying they are typing in the chat I do not see anyting nor am I able to send any messages it seems that my messages continue to have sending above it but it never complete, and the worst part is that this happens often to everyone in my class and",1
very bad experience. It lags a lot and hangs a lot.,0
"This app does not let me join a conference using the phone's audio/microphone (no VoIP), and instead forces me to dial in through a regular phone call. Charges apply. This is simply not acceptable in 2015, especially not for a conferencing app.",0

It is very nice app but one thing is bad about this app that it consumes too much battery.In my mobile it consumes 1% battery only in 5 minutes while my mobile is new. Please fix this problem to extend battery life. Thank you 🙂🙂.,0

"The most convenient way to be interactively involved in a meeting from the comfort of your home, auto or just about wherever you're at. Absolutely love it!!!!!",2
Awful app thats diffucult to use let alone setup.. and very time consuming to do either also. And chews power too fast also,0

The app is very good. I would love to have a feature that shows whether it is a problem with my connection or the person on the other side because of which the voice or video is breaking. There should be something like a small indicator that shows whether you internet is slow,2

I got stressed and very much upset with this new updated version. I keep entering the meeting even though I did'nt left our class meeting. Throughout the class session I just did clicking the link to join over and over again (Ano to? Starting over again? Piolo and Toni?) Kaya I ended up asking my friend to help me in our lesson.

Not the best of virtual meeting apps,1
"I couldn't get any audio or video, even after giving permissions, and multiple attempts. It told me I had an expired certificate for the app when I had JUST downloaded it. It was for court and it definitely failed me. I couldn't hear anything or say anything, but it let me chat. And then the session ended without my participation at all. Not cool. 🤬",0
Nice,2
"As an app for connecting with work colleagues, Teams is achieving our needs. As a personal app on windows 11, it's a no. The app needs to have a total UI transformation for personal use. It should not remind the user of the app they use for work as it makes it difficult to disconnect from work. A feature where the colour scheme and UI changes automatically after 6pm each day for instance and transforms the app into the personal family experience is needed.",2
Great,2
It usually works ok but today the sound was not ing through. Will try a few more times before giving up for the day.,1
"It started getting crashed, with a strange error that it does not support UK English",1
"It wasn't apparent to an inexperienced user how to get audio connected, so I had to call in after losing a few minutes hearing the meeting, and use phone at same time. Another day, presenter had some difficulty advancing slides. There was occasional blank areas, and checkerboard pattern showing up blanking out areas of the view.",1

Very Bad Application. Not easy application,0

I am only giving you 3 stars because I can only put background in my PC can't put background in my mobile.....,1

Hi! I think I'm facing some issue here. I'm not able to see the 'Raise hand' feature in this app. I have installed some old versions but that doesn't work neither. Please tell me how can I make the feature available?,0
Recording option is not there. It will add more value if the developers consider this suggestions,2
Audio seemed overly static. It didn't matter how I was connected through my data or wifi. Also changing devices didn't help.,2

Good,1
"I would like this app to save file directly to Download folder when I tap on a file in a group (or at least offer me option to save or open). Because when the file is opened (even some types of files connot be opened by the default app) but I connot find where the file is (in order to save, move, modify etc.), I feel confused. Thank you.",2
Voice is not clear and video is also not clear,0
"Great app to keep in touch and up to date. However, logs me out frequently and states my password is incorrect, then correct the next few times. Inconvenient in that sense however the app is worth it",1
The computer app is buggy. sometimes the phone app doesn't sync with my computer seamlessly. I would like more control over certain functions like out of office messages via the phone app instead of the need to login in via PC.,1
I dont know what is wrong in this app. I dont mean to be negative abt this but it isnt opening and i have to miss my classes for 4 days due to this. I have tried doing everything but it still doesnt open. I hope the creators will look into it.,0
Haven't been able to use yet because it consistently kicks me out.,0
It shows a block of your name and pic on full screen and blocks the screen which is unnecessary. Too many flaws. This app made my education even tougher to study 👎 (Edit) Change the layout.,0
Push notifications don't work in Workplace or Chat,0
I don't know how to fix my msteams. I have problem when joining meeting I automatically get leave when someone share their screen and I try all other way to fixed but nothing happened.,1

Good,2
Nothing experience yet,2
It has many glitches.,1
This app is one of the best apps I've ever used but sadly the app takes storage whcih is not good for students like me who have lower storage like 8GB or 16GB. Please make a lighter version of Zoom with less features that are not the much important. Dont remove the chat and emoji feature. BTW Great App!!,1
the interference. is boring and look's old!,2

"Overall, the app is pretty good. The bad part is notifications. They're severely delayed most of the time and when they do appear, they appear out of order, meaning, the most recent message gets notified on first followed by the previous ones.",1

Easy to use and convenient in our current life.,2
I just finished my son's parent/teacher conference via WebEx and I am excited to say it went very well. I installed the app and filled in my info- it was that easy. Joining the meeting was just as easy and I am grateful this is available to me for this type of meeting with his teacher. I believe eye contact and facial expressions are imperative to good communication and that's exactly what I received. The entire process was built for someone like me semi computer literate!,2

I use MT just for teaching.There are never any issues that prevent this. Students can always join classes and interact via mic or chat. Sharing the Whiteboard is also good for interaction. Posts and Files are very good tools for keeping everyone on the same page. Outside class time l help students via personal and general chat. I'm not very good with technology but l find this app super user friendly.,2

This app is has no option that we can change the background 😞 because it is so important to students because we have on the camera all was. so many disturbance are there in background like family etc. So please kindly bring this option like blu or change the background .,0
"The app has me stuck in a loop asking verification code, and when I enter it the whole thing repeats.",0
"1) There are times when a mobile phone is ringing and its owner answers it during a meeting, immediately the microphone and/or the camera of Teams immediately opens. 2) When there's an open microphone or a person is talking, possible environment sounds and/or discussions get into the meeting and as result there are sound problems. 3) Meetings would be more effective if the shared content was put on the left part of the screen and the participants or attendeed were put on the right part of the screen as tiles ; exactly as happens in Google Meet.",2

It's a pretty good app but l do face so many glitches one time my child was the presenter and was not able to be attendee one time the teams was working on their own and send unnecessary messages l one time not even able to join the meeting and one time I was pause in the logo of microsoft teams so in laptop no audio was there need use headphones for it so can you do something? I will rate it 3 stars,1
Very good app,1
Nice,2

It needs better internet connection for ultimate performance.,1
Good app. But I do not really know why do companies need this for their workers.,1

"Not bad, but at least me, I'm experiencing issues with the connection during the videoconferences . I miss also the possibility to mute/unmute the micro when doing a video call with many people. You can shut off when connecting, but it's difficult to manage it when the meeting starts.",2
Very bad we cannot even sign in also we cannot join the particular meeting by entering the Id of the meeting it would tell that it is the wrong id even if it is the right one. We can't even put background and we can only put the background in the particular mobiles. But no network issues that's the only good part. And please check on all these problems.😑😐😔🙁😞,0

"Hard to use. VERY UNSTABLE AT TIMES. Also Two or more devices receiving and/or participating in a Zoom meeting must be several feet apart to avoid interference. It is quite embarrassing to be excused from an important meeting because I am sitting too close to my boss and must ""go sit in a remote corner of the conference room to continue participating in the meeting. I'm sure you can visualize my value to the meeting vanishing before your eyes along with any credibility I might still have.",0
Nice app,2
Great connection platform! Some technical difficulties interfered with our meeting but pretty cool how we were able to break out into smaller groups to discuss things and collaborate!,2
"1) Needs a Help/tutorial feature. I can't figure out how to add people to a group.  2) I don't like how it had to sync my whole contacts list into the app. I have a bunch with no phone numbers, making it a waste of time to scroll through. Take a look at Skype. You can pull people up from your list without putting contacts in their app.    3) Option to list contacts by last name.   Neat but not doable for me as can't call w/Skype (Google Voice counts against my minutes).",0
For my last few sessions I had a very hard time hearing members in my group meetings. I don't think is fair to have the sound interrupted all of a sudden just because you get an un- expectect phone call😨 It's also very uncomfortable to shout so they can hear every word I'm saying. Can someone look into that?,0

pointless.",0

The connection since I began using zoom is excellent. I appreciate the updates as well.,2

"Background: My business has been using Teams as a daily driver for file collaboration, multimedia meetings, instant messenger and also as a phone system. We pretty much use every features of this application. We use the windows client and also the android client. We have been using since it's been out. Most people do not use Teams as a complete corporate phone system. Most of my issues are related to the phone system and using the android client. Issues about the android client: 1-Answering a call with a Teams Certified headset, the audio goes through the phone instead of the headset. It doesn't really matter if the device is UC or Teams certified. Tried two different android phones and about 5 different headsets. The apps does it with all of them. 2- Same issue if you get an incoming cell call while in a Teams meeting. Sounds and mic goes through the phone and completely ignores the BT device. Even if you decline the incoming cell call, you are still screwed. This may sound trivial, but imagine your attending a Teams meeting while driving your car. If you get an inbound cell call, the audio goes to the cell phone and you lose your ability to hear or speak in the meeting. Unless you want to stop on the side of the road to toggle your BT device back on with the small speaker icon at the bottom of the app. The android OS itself doesn't lose the BT connection, the app is simply acting up. 3-Delay(3-4 seconds) between answering a call and getting audio. 4- Latencies while in a call. Very annoying because you end up speaking on top of each other. 5- General bad call quality. I find myself rather surprised every time I get a good quality call. It happens once in a while. 6- You get a notification for an instant message and you can actually read part of that message in the notification zone but the actual message doesn't show up in the app. Sometimes have to wait 10-15 minutes before I can actually see it. 7- Ghost calls, you hear the incoming ring but can't pickup because the apps doesn't show the incoming call. 8- The apps doesn't really hang up when you press the hang up button at the end of a call. It does close the UI box but the sound channels remains opened and the other party can still hear until they hang up. The only way to really hang at the end of a call is to actually log out of the app or clear all resident apps from memory. Baseline, as a collaboration tool, it's good. As a phone system, you're better off with the windows client. Use the android client only if you absolutely must.",0
Very good experience........ Simple but elegant,2
Audio clipped a bit but otherwise a solid app,2
It's actually good but there's a limit so i find it hard when were having a online school assembly Can the capacity enlarge base on the person who will join the meeting,2

This app is definitely at alpha state ... hope it games to beta tests soon",0

"Zoom is a good video chat app for secure meetings, including psychotherapy, but unfortunately the user interface is awkward and counter-intuitive, especially compared to Google Duo. I'm aware that some of that could be due to the app's secure nature, but at least it should remember permissions and user preferences. Despite the flaws, I do recommend the Zoom app.",1
"It helps me stream in when I'm sick 🤧. Then it has a calendar so I can see if there streaming, there's a bunch of cool futures for you background in conclusion it is a fun app to use when you're sick.",2

Not bad,2
Diabetes Support group attendance is EASY - even for me! I'm 59 and only somewhat computer/email literate. This is easier than zoom to me. I just click on the link sent to my email and I'm in!,2

I would like to say about this aap that this aap is good for teachers and students in the covid pandemic but the problem in this app is that we are unable to send a personal messages to a single person if we send message it will shown to all and the theme also.,1
App refuses to close. Always running. Doesn't remember credentials. Can't full screen presentations or zoom them. This is a half arsed implementation.,0
Works well. I had some issues a year or so ago but haven't had any for a long time now and I use the app multiple times daily. Even seamlessly allows you to transfer back and forth to other devices. Very handy.,2
Good app but wish it worked with screenshare in Dex mode on my Galaxy S20,1

"Worst app for live meeting. I'll not recommend it to you, it just forgot the id if we not open the application for 2 to 3 days",0
This is a good app but the reason behind giving just three stars is that this app has many network issue and it get reconnect in one meeting frequent times and I have one more suggestions to the company to available virtual background so that this app will be more helpful than now.,1
Its great app for meeting. Lots of options and tools to be working with. But never use it excessively with your phone as it will increase the temperature.,2

After my conference call I even received a summary of the participants and how long each person spoke.  Super cool.  If you like simple, effective solutions, you will love Uber.",2

During yogaasana how to balance breathing as the same has impact on nervous system as well in its perfection. For that some discripition to audions knowlede requires.,1
Nice interface,2
"Running this on Android / LG 30 is problematic for two reasons.  1)  At times it just won't connect over  phone data to my meeting invite.  If at work running on Windows there its just fine where on my phone its hit and miss.  2)  During validation as it sends a text message to the same phone I am validating is a challenge.  The sms message may not come at all or very late, so have the app resend another text with the validation code embedded arrives where when I attempt to update Teams with this code it resets, and send another try to my phone.  The old code fails, new code sent.  Ugly cycle, I miss my meeting.   Please fix",0
As I constantly update the application I find that the application consumes a great volume of data especially during online classes of my daughter and mine as a teacher. This issue needs to be resolved.,1
It kept cutting out and there are no options to put the speaker on another Bluetooth device.. or if I could I couldn't find it. I could barely hear.,1
"Nice to use. Designed good. Few options are hard to find, but it has most of web options..",2
Different appearance. Difficult to use. Notifications are really useful.,0
This app will kick me off all the time and sometimes it doesn't doesn't let me talk it is always on mute and I hate this app. This app sucks and after many times of Uninstalling it and then reinstalling it then it works but only sometimes.,0

"To sign out you have to go into settings. This is clearly making it harder by design so people dont sign out. Its primarily a work app, it should be very quick and easy to sign out and would be a daily task for most people. Make it easy to sign out",0
"All of the features are good, but one drawback is that we can't enlarge our teachers camera.We feel difficult to see what the teacher is writing or showing to us. If zoom activates to enlarge camera, then it would be all very perfect.😷",1

Couldn't hear the host of the meeting when using my phone. It was annoying and made me look like an idiot because I kept having to ask them to repeat what they said,1
Fine.,1
Google meet is better as it is easy to operate,1
So good to use app with one of the best phone technology,1
MAJOR UI BUG : After September update the chatbox gets covered by gboard keyboard. Before the update the chatbox UI would move above the keyboard so that we can see what we are typing. Serious lack of internal testing here. FIX !,0

"At the last parts of the meeting, sounds becoming poor, garble unreadable.",1
"This used to work great. Starting about a week ago, when you try to connect to a meeting it just spins for a couple minutes. When it times out, it ends the meeting for everyone else who joined successfully. Then your customer has to wonder why they got kicked out and reconnect.",0
Good experience with this app,2
Have only used for school and MD appts,1
"So I have tried all the other Apps out there for video conferencing, some are expensive, some lag - this one is simple yet sophisticated.",2
Cool experiance,1
Every single time I use this app for more than about 30 minutes my phone overheats. I literally need to rest my phone on a bag of frozen vegetables to keep it from shutting down. I have a Pixel 3 which is a quality phone and pretty new all things considered. I think the resource demands of this app need to be adjusted for the sake of efficiency. This flaw defeats the purpose of having the app to begin with if it kills the devices it runs on.,0
"I didn't know if I was logged into the meeting. When I sent a chat no response, so I don't know if I was there or not.",0
Very good,2
Don't know do this so it's confusing to me .,0

Please let me know how to go about creating an account. I did fill in the form but haven't heard from the team.,2

Badly behaved on screen rotation. Should follow whatever the system setting is. If auto rotate is off Zoom will still rotate the screen. It's very annoying.,0

The background effect was gone but the overall experience is the best...there's no delays in receiving .,2
It's ok ☺️,2
ThiS app is very good for online study. But my request to company that please add the filter in this app so during classes we look pretty while our camera is on.... I hope you work on it Thanks,1
I can see call on my desk top computer but doesn't appear on my mobile,1
Meh,2
Not installed,2
"Great experience using it for my online classes. Its impressive how light the application is but still works good without crashing even for a call with many participants. Online recordings/transcript is a great feature. If you could allow to use background filters, it'll be the best",2
Most all audio dropped.,0
"sometimes, automatically camera gets on, and the participants space takes too much, can't get minimized",1
Very lag in some time,0

Good,2
Too slow. Not working app please don't install,0
Moving the individual teams into a specific order (I do it by the order of my classes) is very hard on the phone compared to computer. You cant hold one down and move it. I thin you can do it some how but it isn't obvious.,2
works great,2
"This is a third class app for meeting. Whenever I click to install it, it started installing again after installation.",0
Video went dark. The video is too dark but the camera on the phone is working fine. No setting to adjust the colors,1
"Volume is so low difficult to hear especially with background noise, also cuts out frequently when rebuffering",1
Error regarding e-mail is in an invalid format prevented me from joining a meeting. It would not allow me to make the adjustment in an efficient and easy way.,1
It's been a great experience.,2
Works great most of the time. Sometimes chats won't load and I have to go back and reload the chat to get it to populate.,2
Gets the job done. Plan on upgrading to premium in the future.,2
Totally unimpressed.,0
V.good,2
Ok,1
"This app is good, but not that as so as zoom.. The reason iam saying this because,it does not have any hands rising option video and audio issues and so on.. I think zoom as greater than this.. Its secured,eerything are there in zoom",1
Book,1
I've got an important chat from a meeting I cannot access again. Make chats accessible after meetings.,1
It loaded quickly. I was disappointed that I still had to dial in for the audio portion. To use the chat feature required going away from the presentation. Maybe there's a way to see both; I didn't have time to explore the app before my conference.,1
Very confusing to manage everything when there is so much to choose from. Will probably delete tommorow.,1
My call drops by its self in some classes,1
"Excellent app , very awesome ,it meets expectations, it brings every one all over the world in one class hand.",2

Really zoom was very nice and helpful in online studys but I don't know why its getting so much connecting issue while using the app and in other things I think zoom is perfect,0
There's some serious problem with this app especially when you join this with headphones on. Most of the time the person in meeting can't hear me with my headphones on. Earlier it worked fine. Have started facing this problem since last update only.,0
This app is good but it sometime shows that we are entering wrong password but we are entering the correct password There is some a glitch going on from many days in my zoom app that i joins a meeting and it shows that i am the only one in the meeting even the person who started the meeting is not in that same meeting plz fix this i cant take my classes from many days 😢,1
"Audio and image is good, but there should be better synchronization between Mac and phone. If you are in a meeting in the computer the app should know it and automatically log into the meeting",1

This app is good for VC. However yesterday during a VC I could not switch from tablet sound to earphones when I plugged my earphones repeatedly.

"Just had a quick school meeting with the principal and teachers. I didn't have WebEx app on my phone. I had a quickly download it, then open it up. The only problem I had was trying to connect with the meeting, Google try to autofill my name and email. For some reason WebEx wouldn't accept it. I had to manually type it in, then I was able to get in. Otherwise everything else was great 😊",2

Using the app on Android and windows it works great but I have Linux(Ubuntu) for the operating system of the computer I use for school and the app there freezes unless I close all other programs and I shouldn't have to do that on Linux this app is a resource hog,1

Comparably poor sound and usability compared with other conferencing apps.,0
Good but there is a lagging in app and also user status not updating immediately until refresh/restart,2
WEB-ex continues to be problematic. Took me 27 minutes to get on. (Not the 1st TIME) Suppressing the participant list is not consistent with a genuine public meeting. Sound quality was variable.,0
Used it with my doctor and my case manager for a group tele-health session and worked really well.,2
"App is good But when any member Joins the meeting ""A Beep"" like sound comes. It's very Disturbing & Annoying. This system is only in This app. I haven't seen this type of system in another Online meetig apps This is the Biggest Drawback of this app ""And it uses a lot of ""Data"" than other apps""",0

"Why you guys don't add a resolution option in the app which we use in mobile, every time i had to open crime change resolution to join a meeting. It's too annoying. We don't get change resolution option directly in the app, that's the reason the video consumes large amount of data or it we turn it off it will make the video blue😡😡",0
Good for meetings especially for teaching but need to be made more user-friendly like other apps of similar working,1
Not too good .the black color background is too bad.then often it would get out of the class.one plus point is if come out of the meet means also audio and video we can on it can speak.plz crct it often it moves out of the meet.Also nowadays if we comeout from the meet to see other map the teachers voice is breaking the whole mobile gets hanged .plz crct this also plz.it is too bad .,1

"I like google meet app... but as I am using it in my tablet, there is no option for raise hand... please try to fix it",1
I hate this app. Every time I was on call with some my doctor's it was a glitches I was unable to hear what they were saying. But it was other time I was not able to log in and I missed my appointment. The only advice I can give people is don't lay on this app for you life. This app is completely dysfunctional.,0
One star removed as I feel a clearer set of instructions on how the app works would be useful to those logging in for the first time.,2
Webex has been troubling me for a long time now. The voice stops coming if I switch to any other app and if I stay on that app for 2-3 mins webex stops working and says it's not able to connect to the meet. It gets frozen there and I can't even leave the screen to join a new meet. It isn't letting me use any other function when at use. At first I did think it was a network glitch and tried reinstalling the app and restarting my device too. Nothing works. Very disappointed with the app.,0

Nice app,2
The only problem I have with google meet is that I can't screen record our class (as a student). I really need to screen record so that I can rewatch our lessons again. And I also need to screen record because some of our teachers doesn't post their materials in our g classroom. I don't know if the problem is the app itself or our school did something to prohibit us from screen recording.,2
The button to switch to other layout in the app can get challenging to get to the unsure button sometimes. Other then that I love it!,2
Very poor quality and sound,0
It is a nice app but i would like to have virtual backgrounds if pc and laptops can have virtual backgrounds then android phones should also have it. If you add the virtual backgrounds for mobiles then it will be a five star app. 💔💔💔,0

I only use it because I have to for work. Does the job but is lacking in practical features. You can't group conversation together per theme so you end up with 50 active conversations. You can't pin groups ... Only singular chats. I wish this was like discord. You can't search in a conversation per date. You can't tell the difference between conversations and meetings in the chat history. You can't see people's schedules when trying to book a meeting on the app like you can on desktop.,0
Great,2
This app is amazing I have never experienced any complications or negative issues with it for the past 6months that I have been using it. That's why i rate it 5 stars👍,2

This has been a nightmare since I initially installed and try to have a telemed conference. It won't open on my phone it will not load on my phone. I finally was able to get it loaded on my computer on Firefox. I was unable to find anything that showed me how the heck I turn on volume and Camera. So the entire appointment was wasted trying to get this thing to run. I have spent spent hours on Firefox Chrome Microsoft Edge and my phone trying to get this to run properly. Do not waste your time.,0

The recent update made this app totally useless. It hangs and just upsets me. Bring back the older version and layout. This new update seems like a step back.,0
"Loaded to my computer, it has overlayed my scree. Unable to un install as it wont let me into any thing as during the installation it now wants me to pair it to a life sizexroom controller app. Where is that? You go to apps and there is not a life size specific one. Only option is to wipe computer and start again then reload my back up. Should not be this hard",0
"Brilliant app on website and I pay for subscription. Android experience terrible. Poor UX and worst of all, can't use Bluetooth headset...",0
It is good but l didn't get raise hand option,1
There is no virtual background option in android..........???,0
Can't be installed in my phone,0
Poob,0
Highly not recommended,0
Sound quality not good..,0
The audio was extremely bad,0
I could use some little changes feels alittle clunky on the phone. Otherwise it's a great tool for companies and groups to communicate,2
Used for running therapy groups and staff trainings. Wish it allowed for videos but the audio doesn't work for that. Also it drains the battery very quickly on phones. The chat option gets saved to everyone's computer which is a HIPAA issue.,1
Very nice..,2
No email.. not working,0
Video quality wasn't as good toward the end of meeting.,1
Very good,1
"Excellent piece of app. But one thing need to say, kindly increase the timings of meeting because it contains only 40 minutes so we had lose our interest to continue the class. And give the background option for professional meetings, classes and other important meetings. Hope you'll concern about our request. Thank you for your service at this pandemic time.",1
Its good app for small and a quick meetings. But should need high speed connection.,2
"90% failure. The host of the meeting was waiting on me and I was waiting on the host. It took us 20 minutes to get started. They had to send me a new link just to get in. After about 15 minutes, we were disconnected again.",0
Consumes lesser data : Great feature But teachers are mentally torturing students by taking single lecture for more than an hour. Please limit the maximum meeting time to 45 minutes. All the Indian students will be very thankful to developer. We surely give it 5 star rating.,0
"Dear Google, Please add mute all option for the host...",2
Takes time to connect,1
"Well, this app is fine and good really. But I need one feature, if someone removes you from meeting... It can atleast show the name of that individual. And rest of features are fine!",1
"Whatever has happened to zoom... we are having multiple issues now... waiting rooms that dont admit guests, poor quality audio, meetings that get duplicated in diaries with different zoom invites... just a nightmare",0
gd,2
It's good app to conduct meetings online but we cannot use camera when start sharing our screen. If this option added in this app it will be helpful to students to create online presentation.,2
"Very bad connections all the time. Cant hear others, because it cuts out parts of what others are saying. Video quality should be better than what it is. Sorry webex.",1
Voice not clear. It's too low,1
Very clear and concise. Could understand everyone who spoke. Easy access.,2

Great experience there was a slight problem with the audio. The meeting went fine though. Neil's volume could have been higher. Laura did an outstanding presentation.,2

The app is good. But sometimes the Bluetooth connection drops and reverts to speaker/ earpiece. Have to drop and rejoin the call. This does not happen with Teams in my laptop.,2
"The app is amazing...I am using it for attending class..but in the latest update the imoji looks really disgusting,,,, i really liked the old imoji,and a lot of other people too...so please make it as the old one in the next update pls",2
Good,2
"This app is horrible! We loved this app when it had no ""Google workspace."" CANT EVEN MAKE CO HOST AND ONLY LIMIT FOR CALLS IS 1HOUR! What happend google meet? You ruined it! Please rate this app 1 star, I would rate it 5 star if it was not for google workspace! 0/5",0
"A lot of bugs, silent failures. A lot of potential, but too many frequent changes and possibilty not enough testing makes for a hit or miss experie ce.",1
Innovative and professional conference system.  The support team respond quickly to issues.,2
Good but voice problem,1
Excellent,2
"When I started working on zoom, I felt it was quite nice. But nowadays, continuously, I am getting logged out from my zoom account. I had a bitter experience for this reason",0
"My previous review were gone. Idk why. But the problem still persist. I cannot able to hear the audio of my teacher, marking me absent because of this bug or idk, is this like a new feature?",0
Siper,1
Can you please fix zoom on Windows 10? I use it for work and other persons camera freezing after several seconds. Have spoken to colleagues and many people reporting same issue,1
Unable to change background. solve l give 5 star,0
Why does my photo is displayed on the top right corner of the screen when I'm seeing the screen shared in Full screen mode? It obstructs me from seeing whatever is being written in that part of the screen during classes. Please fix that.,1

Easy and fast to setup,2
Before the update it was working fine but now since the update came up it is not working properly and sometimes it does not join the meeting I have even report the problem but still the Dev haven't done any fixation yet so only 2 stars I will rate,0
Best but voice breaking,1

I am using realme 5Pro and am able to conduct meeting thru WebEx, TEAMS, Zoom, Skype etc very well without any hassles...

Chating feature is very useful while going on a meeting Hand raise if we want to clear our doubt while going on a meeting is very useful But there is no opction to zoom in the screen while going on a meeting it is too bad to see the small things Zoom doesn't zoom the screen is very bad And the video quality is very low I think Zoom should improve,1
This is a very unusual app In this app their is not clear video and some other issues Don't waste your Data in installing and updating this app wrost app in whole play store I don't want to give one star also But we cannot write without any star Believe this notification its truth........,0

This app tends to disable your ability to open Word documents after a while of using it,0
Would be great if it supported screen casting to a TV set (e.g. Google cast),2
The sound quality is very poor.,0
"Works well for what it does, but there a few features I really dislike. There are too many notifications; I have mine all turned off now, but that means I have to manually check everything. I also really disagree with the ability for admins to remove the ability for us to turn off read receipts. It feels invasive, but as I need to use the app for work I can just move to a different communication platform.",0
Good but we need (lite) version. It would be better with lite version,2
Would have liked it better if the company meeting url was retained.. Hate that we have to enter it from scratch every single time.. Especially since paste is not enabled for meeting url.. Guess the makers don't use their own app.. to have missed such a simple yet necessary feature..,1

Its overall a beautiful and good application for meetings but just needs to be checked for bugs more frequently and developers should do maintenance more frequently than they do. Good work 👍 to whole team of Go ToMeeting!,2

Where's My review 👹 Here iwill paste it. pls give the tile view on tablet now im always waiting for new update but those updates do nothing.

Only used it once for a webinar and it was fine. They all work like zoom which I know very well. Google meet and things like that. They all launch the same way. Zoom was just how I was welcomed into virtual pandemic life. 🎆👍🎇,2
I can never stop thanking God for zoom especially when we couldn't go to church and visit our families and friends zoom made it possible for us to connect. I pray zoom will never come to an end is my prayer,2

Every time sound problem occurs in this app.on every meeting on of my mate gets problem and he/she can't hear sounds,0
Microsoft runs the world! I'm sure there are other apps out there better to use but most companies are required to use the Microsoft company. With that being said teams is great for what it does. I have been having issues on my laptop and nobody can seem to figure out why. I'm convinced it's teams itself. It randomly loses its add-in to Outlook and then tells me it's unable to be at it I have to repair office once a month to make teams and Outlook communicate.😤,1
It was a quite good app but need to work in offline too and add co-host and hand raise option please .....,2

This message is not no,0
Since 2014 still at lt.,2
Google meet is a good app but because of the covid I have to use it for school and it always says that my internet is unstable when it's not and when my teacher is always trying to talk to me I always lag or she can't hear me so pls make it stop,1
Had a great experience! The video portion did cut out during the meeting for some unknown reason.,2
Great UI.,2
Large file,1
Worst app..never work.. always need to reinstall it before login🤬,0
"Best for meetings, good quality of every thing awesome",2
The app is great. I have one thing that I dislike. When the app is opened from the desktop it keeps sending notification for every message although I read them as part of having a long chat. It's not normal that my phone keeps ringing and vibrationg while chatting on the desktop!!,1
Their is Sound when someone connect or disconnect not Good please turn off it. Because when someone talking the connecting notification sound disturbing vary badly,1

Nice aap but it doesn't allow to take screen recording and it takes lots of data,1

This is a great tool to communicate and share so far,2
Keeps stopping,1
Pathetic app. Has lots of bugs n glitches. Shameful is the fact that I am forced to use this app for official communications as lifesize has contract with my company. Utter disgrace!,0
Aap is so nice but the problem is i can't change my background there was no background button but in my class some children change there background .,2

"I am rating it from my experience on my mobile device. It's difficult to find the kind virtual meetings I am looking for. I can figure out how to navigate my way online, whether it's a website or an app, but not on Zoom. I couldn't figure out how to add my photo. I didn't try too hard but I didn't want to spend too much time trying either. Also, is there a way to bookmark which meetings you like on the App? Is there a way to look for a meeting on the actual Zoom app itself?",1
Network problem,1
This app is AMAZING 👏 we were able to see and hear our love one ❤ and we totally are thankful and grateful for the chance to see our family. Thank You was a Blessing. 🙏,2
Very nice application,2

Easy to use🌸,2
"It probably would have worked better if I wasn't in the area I am, bad internet reception. Other than that I had no problems with it.",1

"After not using this for half a year or something, opened it up and saw nothing. Thought I was kicked of my classes but after 3 days, it 'updated' the directory or something and booted up everything. Huge hassle. Most of all, be it pc or mobile, it's very laggy. Has lots of functionalities but my profs only ever used it like google classroom, which got me frustrated since we could've opt for the smoother running classroom instead. Still a hassle app tho",1
Video quality is just ok. Internet connection is pretty fast but it never seems to improve. Audio is good but it's also annoying that if I'm doing a meeting on a tablet I can't see anyone that isn't talking. There isn't any option to change the video view at all.,1
Not sure,1
Why is there so much difficulty in receiving verification code through sms? This is not very good for me,0
"It was good, if only one speaker is allowed at a time to avoid cacophony.",2

"Battery drainer and always visible/actief in notification bar, standby screen and main screen.",0
Poor audio with more than 2 people. Audio was lagging and intermittent. Could possibly be poor connection but video with 3 people was clear.,0
"Teams is buggy on the pixel 4a. Things like typing in a chat must overcome an occasional bug. I have worked around the fact that you must, sometimes, do away with the keyboard before you can see or send what you are typing. I have also tried to send bug reports and feedback through the app but teams doesn't seem to have been fully beta'd on this phone and OS. So, after having the app collect the system Info, I am stuck with a zip file and nowhere to send it to.",1

Very very bad app. Works well only on desktop device. Mobile app doesnt work. And in mobile browsers works bad.,0
"Weak audio. In several recent Webex Meetings, I've found the audio volume to be very low. With everthing turned up to max, the meeting participants are still nearly inaudible. No such issue with Zoom, Meet or Teams meetings.",0
Sometimes it consume more mobile data when it is in meeting process ... So this is not fair... Because of this reason I miss my next classes 😓😓plzzz do something it's more important 🙏🙏,0

"Works good most of the time but will sometimes drop my audio, video, or both",2
It's good to use but the issue is of virtual background. It is only supported in certain Android mobiles. A mobile or a computer which is one or two year old version does not support virtual background which is not good. A simple software which supports all Android including old versions should be able to get this virtual background.,1
This app is good but it doesn't work on old version mobile phone's. So I request you to please fix this problem ASAP!,1
Login is absolutely broken: sometimes it magically logs out and autofill with Google doesn't work properly. Dark theme is also broken.,0
ho hijo,2
"I love this app on my laptop, but not on Android. There is no option to join existing room. I can only create a new room. Very confusing!",0

It was a snap to join in the meeting. I didn't have to punch in any password. I love it!! Picture and sound quality are great!! Update. It's September 18th 2021 (the above paragraph was 2-8-2021) and I'm still happy with this app. No complaints!!!,2
Used to be free,0
This app was good but now this is the worst app in the world. 1. Whenever I enter the app its automatically log outs and requires password. 2. After the update I cannot open documents this is the biggest problem I am facing hence i cant submit my assignment. I am very disappointed the update comes and the app is getting more worst. Please remove these problems any way or I will have to uninstall. Please remove these problems today.,0
"Overall usability is fine, but still many bugs are there, can not use when it needs in emergency, getting hang-up, graphic issue also noticed in the app. More way to travel",1
"The app and desktop works great, you just need to warn users when the darn thing goes down for updates, and or maintaining. Disrupt important meetings and calls, like 1999 all over again.",2
"Worst app, in this app in a few minutes start a meeting consuming high data, so please 🙏 don't use this app anyone",0
"Audio was slightly breaking up for several minutes when it stopped altogether so had to phone in and needed a passcode to hear it. But the time I did all that lost a chunk of information because I was looking at graphs, etc. without the explanation. Video was fine.",0
"Everything is fine while using through laptop, but today I faced the worst experience while joining a meeting through mobile phone. It's showing 'unable to connect to the webex server' everytime when i try to join. And finally i couldn't join the meeting !!",0
Not great 😕 kept shutting my camera off!,0
"When the host / anybody is doing a screen share and they play a video that has audio with it. If you go to another app still expecting to hear it, the audio will stop, but you can still hear others background noise. This happens on Android, but iPhone users don't experience this! Why?",0
No video. Only audio. That's also not clear..,0
Good,2
This was great please respomd to my question can we have Lol,2

Why There is no background filter in samsung galaxy tab A6 & oppo A92?,1
to much new stuff to figure out.,0
Actually this app is good but some changes are required for example a teacher can mute all the students at once and than they could not unmute themselves sometimes all the students are speaking at once this creates lots of disturbance in the class. Second thing is a teacher could not view his/her picture on full screen. This change is required as if teacher is showing something to students than it would be difficult for him/her to see. Thank you,1
this app is very easy to use and access. it makes learning and teaching possible to share your content.,2
Cancel online class,0
Call me option doesn't work most of the times it takes ages to receive a call. All of a sudden internet audio goes mute and have to redial back again and again. So pathetic experience while attending any urgent meetings,0

"My Bible study group has been using zoom since the start of the pandemic. We meet every Tuesday night and we are all very happy to be with each other this way. ❤ When we first tried it out, several of us were having trouble w getting the video w the sound. Most of us had to rely on the 2 people that were tech minded to help us. But it came easy for us eventually. My one friend Louise uses zoom often for her charity meetings.",2
Gi,2
I think is most use full,2
Audio was not very clear. Maybe due to attendees mics not being muted.,1
Laggy audio,1
Every time I open the chat for a recurring meeting I have to scroll manually to the end. There are such serious UI flaws in this app.,0
Would not connect,1

Sometimes hard to connect to my Family on zoom calls. Maybe operator error ❓,2

Very nice app useful but I can't get virtual background option in my tab,2
Updated review: 3 stars up to 5 stars because after flashing my Pixel back to Android 11 all my apps are working ok again. (Zoom on Android 12 was broken for me - did not open rooms from URLs.),2

Best for online teaching,2
I'm using this app from a week for my college classes. When I installed it it was amazing But after 3–4 days I'm facing some audio issues. I can't hear anyone.,0
For the past 3 zoom sessions I get message that the zoom app is overheating. I get kicked off line. Tried a reinstall but no luck!,0
The sound and video is clear and crisp. Would appreciate if you can extend the zoom meeting from 40 minutes to 1 hour max if possible.,2
Very good,2
our school'meeting is held on this app its good but again and again says that trying to re connect even in full range sometimes mic stops working and the qualityof video is not good at all,0
Excellent app but some time it gets eaco in the meeting,2
Not very good interface,1
Worst app,0
Very cpu intensive on two way video. Compared to the alternatives is just isn't as smooth due to the computing power needed.,1
Im not being heard during the meet on Laptop. All jacks seemed to be working fine. Problem only arises with Google meet on Laptop. Whereas on phone it works perfectly fine.,2
Super very very good shepherd,0
"So many bugs like on plugging headset sound comes from phone speakers sometimes, can't see join button most of the times and some more bugs. This app is so annoying. And on laptop it hangs so much and freezes the system. Edit : After recent update assignments don't open anymore. So how do you want people to submit assignments without knowing the questions.",0
"I don't really understand how this gets worse over time. It was fine for basically a whole year, then started having issues. Is Microsoft not one of the largest tech companies in the world? This 9-1-1 bug is life threatening.",0

I just can't use the app for desktop,0
Nice,2
Satisfied enough for meeting,2
It's net taking and also some problems in Connection,1
Does not have an option to turn on the speaker.  I have to hold it to my ear to hear the meeting.  What? You didn't think of that? We spend too much on this system to have such a crap app.,0
There should be unsend message option And sometimes mic does not work,0
Why do I have to call in to a conference when I have an app and good wifi,0
"I use Google meet to watch movies and dramas with my friend, this is great way to communicate with classes and other people.",2
Video problem if will stake my phone,1
The video was great. The sound fades in and out. Making it hard to understand what the other person is saying.,1
It is good just it asks for rating after every meeting,2
"During this end times of CORONA experience and social distancing, zoom is the best answer to the new way of socializing together. Yes, Zoom is the best. Go for it now. Do not look left or right. Just go straight ahead and download Zoom and you will be able to have a video chat with anyone in any part of the world. Go for it. Go for ZOOM. It's the best communication tool ever.",2
Waste consumes more battery 🔋 And if we turn on video it doesnot show our video in participants list and while we are running zoom we cannot record our screen....,2
"Great way to communicate within my classes however, the profile picture keeps glitches to the profile picture everyone starts off with aka the one with your initials. Please can you fix this? Thanks!",1

"At times my audio during virtual calls is bad, and I don't know why 🤷🏾‍♀️",1
It has upgrades and helps people communicate with each other for free for only 30 or 25 mins after that make anew meeting and talk. They should make meeting timeless for everyone even the ones who don't pay for the app.,2
Overall it is useful but needs practice,1
"The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because when I was using a internet only phone where once the hotspot was not using high-speed. During all of meetings it would cut off an go back in the meeting every 3-5 minutes my whole one hour meeting every single meeting when I wasn'tusing high-speed internet, which caused me to miss parts of my meetings, which was 90% of the time that's I wasn't using high-speed. If you guys fixed that problem than I would give 5 stars because when I did have",1

Great app but high men..,1
suparb,0
Make this app light weight for both Smartphones and PCs. Also make it more responsive. For eg: Google meet is such a good. You guys can leave google behind by just focusing on the many small small things.,1
nice app,2
It have countless network issues and Once you set your profile picture it hard delete because there are only option to change it not delete it.,0
The first time I used it it worked fine. I attended an online group. Later I could not access Teams because I did not have a work or school email. I do not go to school nor work. I write and am a homemaker. You must just let a person use their email.,0
😍😍,0
Its good but some times data not getting updated. ( like shift schedule n report).,2
"Decreasing one star because "" TODAY I NOTICED THAT WHEN I REMOVED MEET FROM MINIMIZE CORNER 2 IT WAS IN THE MEETING FOR 3 HOURS MORE UNTIL I NOTICE IT IN NOTIFICATION BAR WHICH IS DISGUSTING IT TOOK ALL MY INTERNET AND IT WOULD BE SHOWING PEOPLE THAT I AM IN MEETING.....SORRY BUT DISAPPOINTED ....

Automatic log out is happening.... Can't hear anything from the meeting participants Fix it as soon as possible,0
The app is very good,2
I can't see my assignments and when I press the assignments it doesn't open. Pls fix this!!!,0
Generally teams are a decent app. But who oh who both the buttons for mic on/off and the sound volume slider and on/off buttons aren't always visible for the user wile conferencing. Also joining conference either without any sound whatsoever or with both mic and sound? why not give the user the ability to join with sound only? That's rubbish interface design.,1
"The general app is fine for the most part but falls short in important mobile features. Notifications that ask to join a meeting don't open the app when ""join"" is clicked, much less open the meeting. Audio is a nightmare. I use a Bluetooth headset with my phone for all other apps and although Teams can see it, it forces audio to ""device"" without explanation. Days it does work, it's still 50/50 if it will use the mic. Today it said audio was through ""device"" but was actually speaker.",0
The sound was off and echoing..The video was freezing as well,1
The sound is low on the app. I am unable to use app without using the call feature.,0
Good application,2
in my phone in google meet it not comeing any change background option and i also uptated my phone and i see other have the chang background option please fixed my problem,0
Trying to delete an old account that I no longer have access to. Requires me to sign in to that account before teams even launches. So I'm here to uninstall the app. And I guess leave it uninstalled.,0
"In the recent update, the option to pause a live video is gone. Seekbar is unavilable.",2
Ok,1
Good,1
This app does not allow me to change layout- only show up to 6 people per page and I have to slide back and forth. Tried everything but the icons are not there!,0

I wish there was a setting where the app didn't log out ever. There is enough security with my phone login. Usually I need to use the app right when my conference is starting and then I have to fumble and login and make everyone wait.,2

For some reason the connection between my devices and Teams server is horrible, i had to constantly change between my wi-fi and mobile data just to reconnect to a meeting and i had to practically buy a new SIM card.

This app worked great until it decided to tell me that it was no longer supported on my phone. Something about the cpu wasn't right when it worked fine before. I checked for an update on my phone but there was nothing. It updated fine on my laptop though.,2

It's hard to find out is your video screen being showed for others to see you. It keeps saying presenter needs to make you viewable. There is a small screen in your device that shows you but it doesn't allow others to see you. It's a bit confusing when you have 4 or more in a video meeting.,2

Anyways:) Very nice app. A BIG THUMBS UP!!!!!. Edit1: Hey I replied this on 15 July and coming here after 1.5 month. It has transformed into a disaster(in good sense). Great steps but 1 thing i want to mention is poor audio quality. It is really very poor, especially after attending 3-4 meeting, voice breaks alot.",1
Padam,0
I can attend my classes but in the middle of the class I get leaved instantly and then it says me that this meeting requires a newer version of the app and update your app. I go to play store but there are no updates available. I restart my tab 2-3 times still not working. I even delete the app 3-4 times still the same issue. What can I do to fix this?,0
All things are good in this app. But can you please add the background fecher on mobile also is you add it you will get 1 star more,2
Very nice.,2

Nice app,1
Good app but there is one problem we can send chat message it will be seen all participants and I wish that it can be seen only participant those I am chatting,2
"Why NO JOIN AS GUEST after accepting an invite and downloading the app? This is confusing to guests. I have to provide guests with a work around (“after downloading the Teams app go back to the invite, tap it and the join as guest will be an option” or “first download the Teams app, then I will send you an invite”). Using the workaround is clunky! I have tested the process numerous times on numerous Android devices to be sure that I wasn’t missing something. I prefer Teams, but Zoom provides a much simpler experience for guests. This needs to be fixed, because I know of other organizations struggling with the same issue when the guest is on Android.",0

Good app for meeting purpose,0
generally good. my one gripe is that notifications for messages keep reappearing and piling up even after you have read them.,1
"I just finished a meeting and the picture + audio were fine on both ends, which is why I want to give a high rating. However, the functionality and supposed available features were not at all user friendly. Confusing and time consuming to figure the app out. Honestly, I still don't know how to navigate my way through the app and its uses. The actual meeting time was good though.",1

No interruptions. Clear audio and video. Students simulcasting/virtual getting information as if they were in the classroom.,2

V informative and knowledgeable It give us lot of knowledge we learn mlot of experiments,2
This is really good but has a major flaw.It only supports video conferencing max at 720p! In 2021 this is too low and really frustrating because sometimes it drops to even 480p.,0

Worst app,0
👍👍👍👍,2
I like this app for the most part. It has been pretty stable for me and I feel like I can depend on it but there is one thing I would like to see. I would like there to be a way to get notifications when someone messages me directly that doesn't involve a notification every time someone messages in one of our group chats. As far as I can tell this is an all or nothing setting.,1
Good quality but many network not support so is incriss network quality,1
"It is not operating properly.. It some of the times shows connecting for a Eternity, even if the network is good.. To ensure the network i check to use net in other app and its working very well in all if them but zoom still shows connecting...

My mic is not working and my exam today 😭,1
This app is only for working companies..its not a normal facebook.. thats why you cant sign in unless you have a work compaine group set up..,0
It would be great to be able to see more then 6 people at a time. Zoom can see more people them GoToMeeting. Not sure how 6 people get picked to be viewed all the time. Get interfearence from people that do not mute them selves while another petson is talking so have lrft meetings because of it. Have addressed it to the people that do it and the organizer and same people refuse to mute them selves. I already am hearing impaired and now not using this app as much because of it. 4-30-2021 Friday.,2

For some reason it wouldn't show any other of my contacts and I'm not sure why. I tried refreshing but nothing. Restarted the app. Nothing!",0
Whaly I USE workplace When i have slack free !! 😒 When workplace became free I'll come back again .,1
I only used it one time. Today. It had background echoing and glitchy. I was on a important job interview so that was not good. I ended up using the video part but not the voice part. They probably thought it was me or my internet but I know it wasn't because I used Skype recently and it was fine. Hopefully you can work out the glitches soon. Thanks.,1

"1. Many times this app won't respond (audio gets disconnected in between a meeting and same with video. Sometimes the screen goes blank when someone is sharing the screen in a meeting) 2. ALSO, many times we won't be able to login though we enter the correct meeting ID and the internet connection is proper. When tried to login to the meeting, it shows ""Report Problem.

"While decent for chat it has a slew of issues that a finished app shouldn't have. When you change your password it can get caught in an endless login cycle that sometimes isn't even fixed with a restart. It takes an incredibly long time to sync conversations, sometimes it just won't sync. The reply button is far too close to the new post button. What it decides to notify you on is inconsistent and will often leave notifications up for things you've already checked. It has a lot of features, some of which are great, but the core app feels like rushed garbage that barely works. This is true for both desktop and mobile. They continue to adds more features but really need to take some time to fix core issues that make it incredibly user unfriendly",0
Most useful at work place. Very easy to use and keep connected with your team at all the times. I was looking easy platform to connect with all my team members in one group. This one came handy. File sharing and tagging in group are few Best features of this app,2
"Have to close and reopen all the time. I will touch on a user to send a message and the app will just flicker and go back to the list. When I close the app and reopen, it's fine. Happens several times a day though. Very inconvenient",0

The audio will not play with the video. This has been for the last several sabbaths. I have to connect both phone to hear and video to watch which still does not show full screen. Also the call in this week was a very bad connection and it was church wide not just me. 3/20/21 it would be nice if the speaker's screen could be enlarged to full screen and cover the entire viewing.,1

"This is a weird system. I'm sure it's great for the security. It seemed secure, but that made it difficult to get in the meeting. The ""join meeting"" type button in my doctor's portal should have taken me to the app, but instead it tried to open in a browser, where I could not be seen by the doc. Luckily I figured it out quickly, but I had to find a link to copy and paste. That was partially the office's fault, but it seems like a complicated system.",2

Well the problem is with your your problem is the need of a drop-downmenu when you're in your meeting you can go back and read it or mute it or unrated where to set your camera to turnthe especially when it comes to the the drive mode it's got to be easy for somebody mode for sure does drive mode problem is you can't go back you're stuck there and then redirecting there can be productive for anytime anyone first did you simpl will tell you that drop menu do the settings of the app,0

"This app allows you to join meetings easily, but it fails when it comes to casting to a bigger screen. Compared to Disney's app or YouTube it is pathetic that you have to go through other apps to do screen mirroring.",1

Good audio,2
Nice app,2
I know,2
Use this daily for work and have been pleased with meeting quality! It's gotten better over the years and easier to use. The only issue I've come across infrequently is voice quality but I think it has to do with the wireless provider I may be using at the time.,2
A issue is there that if network is not coming then it do not shows us a option of leaving sometimes. Please solve this matter 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽,1
"This used to work great. Starting about a week ago, when you try to connect to a meeting it just spins for a couple minutes. When it times out, it ends the meeting for everyone else who joined successfully. Then your customer has to wonder why they got kicked out and reconnect.",0

Well,2
Better than Skype. But the ability of file sharing to be improved a lot better.. at times app gets slow despite of having a 6gb Ram phone and with no other apps running at the same time. Pls check.,2
Great,2
"Well, I could say the uses of zoom truly helps in these online era in my country. But it's such a pity for mobile users, several types cannot change the background meeting. It would be so much better if more phone types could use it.",2
I'm in the IT department for my company and was looking forward to testing this software.  However after installing the app I was greeted with a message that my device is not supported.  This baffles me since I am running lollipop and my android device is only 1 year old.  Needless to say I already deleted the app and determined it will not work for our company.,0
Un able to change background..it is not showing background option,0
Not opened by using invitation link,0

Although it took a while to be able to connect but I found the app quite useful. The sound was rather unsatisfactory though .,2
The video kept breaking up and the sound was choppy sometimes I couldn't understand what they said and the other person's face would break up into pixels this is the first time I've had trouble with the audio and Vizio on this meeting don't know what was wrong this time but I hope you fix it,1
Cannot be found ? Why.,0

Audio was very choppy,1

The work experience in this app is not very good..,0
Amazing,1
I have little or no problems while using this app. We use ii every day for Conference call at work. You can hear clearly but sometimes there is an echo especially when we are doing video conferencing. Other wise I would recommend this app to friends and family. I've already introduced it to my church.,2
I wish we could get more pictures of attendees during the mtg.,1
Excellent app for online meetings. Every time I've been on one of these meetings it's been clear and the videos work.,2
The screen turns off whenever the camera senses it's dark or phone goes landscape. Really annoying when you have something to do while in a call. It won't turn on back again unless I turn it to portrait or keep it away in the dark.,0
"After lockdown, the class is going on in online in our home and i continuesly using google meet.And believe! me this app has no any type of problem such as voice cracking,and many more.So, if I wants to talk with any group or with friends or to attend the class,l always use this google meet!",2
This app is consuming most of the RAM and slows down the device. Experienced this whenever i downloaded this app.,0
Need more options or controls to the host,2
"Sound, and Stability of network needs to be improved.",1
Always having problem with this app,1
Good 👍,2
It's a 1,0
I works pretty well. Please enable picture in picture on Android.,2
"Not optimized for smartphone use. Too much bandwide required, huge amount of mobile data is used during a meeting. The speaker window is too large, overlapping the presentation's content. Difficult to see/follow the chat during a Meeting and it quickly drains your battery",1

This is discasting. The blutooth device connecting option is not showing on mobile. Please make sure. and give blutooth device connecting option,0
I'm giving this 3:star to check it out first before eating it more :),1
Mic problem,0
"It's not worth downloading except if you mind being tensed, anxious trying to log in. I tried signing in with the right information hundreds of time to join a meeting but wasn't successful. When you try to reset password it says you've tried before try tomorrow. Why does everything Microsoft do, be difficult? ou say you don't recognize the same mobile number that has been sent and signed up with, what kind of thing is that. You guys made me miss an interview. Please improve.",0
Good,2
It's really useful but I can't see screen when someone share screen clearly,1
Mtg was supposedly moved due to too many people joining and I wasn't able to get to the new website,0
"It works great for some time but after getting update it works more slower than usual ,it also affect my device storage too......",1
"Useful features but unreliable. I was on a low-speed connection and sent a series of chat messages. No indication was given that they did not successfully send. The website will tell you if you have a connection issue and the chat didn't send, but the app basically lies to you and makes it look as though the messages went through. I have uninstalled the Teams app and will now be manually visiting the website to avoid the app's unreliability.",1
Ok,2
Very slow,1
"Great app to use, easy to find information and join conferences! Conference call quality is very crisp and clear. Never had any reports of issues joining. Also, the reminders and call recap notifications are really helpful!",2
The app is good but in my class when I switch on my video then suddenly I get disconnected from the meeting one day I was doing the class it was going my oral test and man said to on the video but when I on I suddenly get disconnected and my marks also get deducted so please Google to something this is a very problem matter please do something please please please please please,1

This app is not good in speaker sound. The sound of speaker is distorted. Please improve it.,1
Good,2
"Drains battery at an insane rate, many connectivity issues, terrible audio and stabilization, and simply unappealing to look at in general. Do not waste your time with this app.",0
Good but it takes a lot of time when someone joins. And it also shows an error . And Google meet is a good app it never show technical issues and others.,1

This app doesnt work properly after sisign up..I think waste of time,0
"Since my university using Microsoft Teams as their official platform for education, I couldn't imagine doing the same without it. Reliable, easy, automatically synchronized, and has everything you need for your student's life. Bravo 👏",2
I love it and its free! We use it every day its a big help to us. We can come together to pray and be strengthened. It is a reliable resource. Check it out for personal or business needs. I would reccomend it. Thanks Uber Confrence,2
"When I create meetings and join them and try to present my screen, it kicks me out of the meeting. Idk what's wrong with the App but it's not expected from any app which is developed by google.",0
Cool but the audio needs to be fixed,1

By mistakenly my app has uninstalled now my background is not coming again what to do and what to say about net my god the net is much needed to class plzz to something google..,1
"Great for keeping in contact with colleagues. The mobile app works very similarly to the desktop version, so it's pretty intuitive.",2
"The audio was in and out (might be connection issues). The video seemed eratic in transitions, not smooth. The management interface does not seem as intuitive and functional as Zoom. I'm disappointed.",0
It is a very good app because we can learn about new things also in our homes.,2
When you are about to join a meeting zoom class then it randomly says the meeting passcode was wrong then i use another device and it work 20 minutes later my other device randomly JUST WORKED this is a very huge problem imagine if you are in a business meeting then you cant join for 20 minutes..,0

"I love zoom app but when I start the meeting and after 40 minutes, the meeting was over. They said that I will need to upgrade to pro but I don't know how to upgrade so please tell me how to do it.",1
"I dial in with my cell phone, continue working/multitasking on laptop, and want to be able to open the app on my tablet and  leave it open to see who is speaking, monitor, record, mute, et cetera.  The app won't do that though.  It prompts me to dial in using Skype, and won't bypass to let me into the conference.  On the web interface, you can do so, by telling the system that you have already dialed in.  This kills the app's functionality. I love the overall service (I am a premium subscriber)",0
The only issue was it switched to the hosts screen and my video on my phone showed myself on the bottom and my children that I was talking to on the top but then would switch over to the host who was just listening in and had no reason to be covering the screen of my kids. Even when she signed off of the video her initials would pop up and it would just be a blank screen and I still couldn't see the kids and there was no real option to switch over to the other screen it seemed like,0
خوب بود,1
Ok,2
Please give tamil captions in Google meet,1
This is the worst app I had ever used. It uses a lot of storage and Internet.,1
It's very good make options for voice recorder,2
I give 1 star bc when i install this app and abput to go in a online class it said this app needs to be updated to join but i already updated it please fix it.,0
I love the feature where I can transfer from a live PC teams meeting to my phone app without others knowing I have done that.,2
Best video conference application with many effect and video backgrounds,2
Connectivity is too low at every place,0
"I really love UberConference with it's nice interface and easy functionality. Unfortunately it's too limited. Boasts video and screen share capability but invites only mention dial-in option, video is laptop/computer accessible only and recording only captures the audio. For the money I pay as a business account member, Zoom offers a lot more and I have unfortunately outgrown this platform. I will miss UberConference!",1

Microsoft Teams is a fantastic all in one solution to allow teams to Collaborate. With the ability to add voice functionality I really don't need to worry about missing calls whether I am in the office or on the road. It has great add-ons that makes the user experience really good. Awesome,2
its good,1
Great app so far. Like the UI. Easy to follow,2

It is bad app in world.,0
Zoom is a video chat app. This app gets you what you really need during meeting. This app has many different features that makes it pretty easy to use even for beginners. Try it out and you won't be regretted.,2
Why say link expire 😐😐,0
Bukurë,1
Not grat it not sibg in,0
Traumatic experience just a peice of annoying app,0
Great conferencing application overall. The only feature I'd really like to see is Mute-Unmute action on headset button press. Right now it behaves little odd: handsfree button press switches audio to the speaker and I need to get phone and switch audio back.,2
"We used this line for our prayerline. It's a blessing , full control of the line from dashboard. Awesome.. Love it!",2
2021-02-04 update Some improvements but I still get randomly disconnected while using the app on my phone with good cell signal and solid wifi.

"Can't join rooms on Android, many other people have the same Problem for a long time now",0
"If the app could maintain a meeting/call long enough, maybe the app could be half way decent. Unfortunately, it can stay connected long enough to even be considered a terrible app. Please figure out what other apps have been able to excel at in a mobile environment with many network types. A business communication app needs to be able to connect, transfer, transition, across and between network types flawlessly, without issue - let alone constantly dropping meetings and calls.",0
Occupied very large space,0

"Poor quality and reception, even on audio only mode, with both full wifi and cellular. Better web meeting options available than webex.",0
"Surprisingly good. Much better than using regular fb for work-related stuff: important posts don't get buried because everyone hits ""like"" on a pic of someone's baby, but seem to pretty much remain organized by time/date. Users who struggle with new apps but who already use Facebook will probably find the interface fairly intuitive. One drawback: app sometimes randomly decides not to send notifs for long periods of time. This could be due to my own device settings, though, so no stars deducted.",2
"I cant open attached files on assignments and it sucks. I tried doing everything like reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, clearing data and caches but nothing happened. I still can't open files from assignments. Im now using samsung a52 and it has the latest versions. So why? I really nedd help right now cause I'm using this for school. Thanks",0

"Basically does not work when you need it to work with no reason at all. Worst app for meeting UPDATE: the new update is worst than the one before it, it does not recognize my phone number at all.

If I receive a meeting link it works from PC but it doesn't work from the app, this is really frustrating, I will never use it for work like this..",0

My mother don't want to believe that Douglas Kevin Hawthorne Jr. is really gone what mother wants to except that her son is Gone. I need to make my mom happy and get Kevin a headstone.",0
It's very good app but in logging it is something little bit of problem but it is fine,2

Also the video is glitchy, the audio and video don't match up, and the audio is glitchy. PLEASE fix these.",0
Nice one!!!,1
Couldn't see screen sharing,0
Good,2
Share Content should be continuous.Next content should be screened simply by scrolling. Time Ltd should be unlimited . Participants Ltd should be increased to minimum 200. Video Zoom in & out facility should be added. Very important participants mobile numbers must be visible / identifiable. Host can see/ control the individual chats. Participants Videos can be on by the host.Sending emoji by participants should be controlled by the host,2
Not user friendly. Could not hear unless l put the phone up to my ear.,0
Good app.,2
Some problems during the meeting where there was no audio and it had to restart. Other than that it was fine,2

Great app but high men..,1
Its ok....the video outlay needs serious adjustments. Cant see more than one person at a time on my Mobile device. Not sure if its different on other device.

I can't change my background in the meeting my phone is Vivo Y12 please fix it otherwise meet is best that's why I'm giving you 4 star in the place of 5 stars,2

"It's an impressive application, true to its name of teams for collaboration, there's are things that are confusing in its use when you switch from SharePoint to teams, the line between both is blurry. However I do believe that you are on the right track, I now, with the last update we have the hability to replay chat message making reference of a previous one.

Hum I thought this could replace Webex or similar however it doesn't give you a local number to call .... please provide a local number based on location of the caller,0

This session was very well explained very explained for pre primary school children and it has helped me a lot in teaching small children in practical way by showing natural beauty while teaching any topic and showing real objects while teaching in school.And even as a parents must be educated by themselves so that they can teach their own children . And as a teacher when l teach my students l should be very free with the small children and be a child and love their inocent of the child.,2
Sound went out a few times and eventually froze and had to end the call but untill then it was good.,2
Most of the devices it doesn't work. This is the 3rd device I had to use. Very annoying,0

"Issues with Bluetooth Headset only for this App. If a lifesize call is interrupted due to an incoming mobile phone call, there is no way to resume the call on the headset and lifesize call switches to phone speaker. To resolve you have to disconnect the call and call in again.",0
Rubbish not easy to use and confusing when I can get on. Unable to reset password when it expires with no warning without link.,0

Absolutely love Teams. This would be a five-star review if there were widgets available for Android,1
Very useful,2

I've been in a Recovery program for 15 months.This platform is what we use for our individual 1on1 meetings with our counsler and our i.o.p group.It constantly has issue logging in.Alot of the time you log in to you group meeting and it seems to be buffering or connecting for us to 10-15 minutes. It will not stop and reconnect just leaves you holding your breath.They are on average 25-30 people in my Recovery group.It seems like every other person that speaks has bad quality audio.(ZOOM)#1,0
Best app for online studiess,2

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP TO ANYONE THAT CAN USE ZOOM INSTEAD!!! How it got MOSTLY 5 stars on reviews chart is mind boggling since MOST REVIEWERS GAVE IT 1 STAR AND THE SAME FRICKIN PROBLEMS!!!",0
Its an ok app but why does it take up so mucb spcae,0
Good...... ☺️,2
It is a must have for online meeting and other usage. It is easy and affordable,2
Sometimes the audio is not clear and the presentations are sometimes blurry.,1
App is fine sometimes quality of sound and video is bad. Also there are some technical bugs too. But overall it's normal,1
"Joining a same call from a different device now doesn't make sense. I don't understand why it gets worse every update. When enabling mic during a call on Android 12, an ongoing call needs to be hung up and rejoined.",0
"The apps great and all, but i keep disconnecting every 5-10 mins during my class session, My internet was not part of the problem since i have a stable connection.",1
Such a buggy app. Phone vibrates at odd tikes during the call. Call quality is poor at best. Muting and un-muting are cumbersome at best and highly likely to get stuck. Overall there at too many alternates to make this service worth trying.,0
Very good,2
👌👌👌👌👌👌,2
A very good place to work chat whit co worker,2
Why don't have background Google meeting android phone please fix help me,1

It's strong and nice,1
Most imperfect software I don't know why my office has taken your service. Your app kills our mobile by heating it like anything. You don't have recording option Your Connectivity is terrible compared to other competing application. Pathetic software.,0
"Really good app, i barely use this cause i have other meeting apps but i use this for my school activities, etc. But i wish there was a feature in Android that we can have backgrounds when we are at a meeting! it would be a blessing if we have an update like that 😅",2
Thanks,0
Awesome,2
I only give this 3 stars cause it wont let me put a background and it's kinda annoying..please let everyone put backgrounds,1

This app is good but the only problem is sometimes the buttons are not working properly and the background audio is not good as much as it is in google meet and the most important thing is this app does not have a data saving option and the mobile internet drags too much even when I turn off my camera and mute my audio also its dragging too much of data so please by the time of the next update at least solve these issues.,0
This App is Very Good to Talk with your Friends!!,1
Nice but sometimes it automatically log me out,1
Nise,1
Switching between two work places with different emails as user name is impossible without logging out and logging back in. Not good.,0
"The app indicates to be offered by ""Google commerce Ltd"" which does not seem to be accurate as lifesize is a US company with no reported link to Google.",0
Excellent one but dependence on local cellular network decrease it's performance. Overall experience is excellent.,2
It is very good app,0
خحح,2
It was a success to some extent. Subsequent modifications need to be given to give any other such video conferencing a virtual lively affair.,1
Consumes lots of data,0
Ok not that bad but a little bit changes should be there,0
Thank You So Much... Love You... 💖💝💖,2
"This app was damn good in the beginning. But suddenly what happened don't know. When I attend it shows connecting. And after 10-15 minutes it shows error occurred. The same problem with my friends, mate and with my teachers also. Please do something with it!",1

"Good, but not great. I was only able to get audio to work if I joined with a phone call. That was annoying, but I am grateful the audio worked. I could not get the video to enable, to show myself. That was difficult to deal with in a meeting where I needed to be seen.",1

Really well done app for conferencing with colleagues. Takes best aspects of the web app and works great on my Nexus 5. Highly recommend UberConference,2
It's a good app and I like it but when I share the screen it is sometimes hang or my class disconnect. So that's why I don't like this app much. As I tell it gets hang or my class get disconnect. That is the reason behind I don't like this app much that's why I am giving only 3 stars,1

As good as some of the other apps on my phone. Voice and video breaks happened every now and then.,1
Good,2
Really good app. Sound and Video quality never fails me. A recommendation to the developers at Microsoft. The only time the app gives issues is if someone with an extremely bad internet connection does not mute themselves. This causes everyone's voice's to have low quality instead of only the one user with the poor internet issue.,2

"Should ask the permission to on video once again even after taping on the video button.. Bcz it cteates a mess when someone by chance tap that button.. Like in the cisco webex meet, include the option to preview the video to ourselves first.. Before showing to others in meet.",1

"It is a great app for calls and chat, for me, i have this app since covid began and used it for online school. I gave it 4stars because of the Internet errors that RARELY come. Wish you subscribe in my YouTube channel.",2
The latest layout is utterly disastrous. Please change it to something more user friendly. Do take note that the trend is a waning sliver of thought and designing the interface based in that trend is equivalent to leaving the app in the dirt.,0

Options for raise ✋ and add host can make it easier to use. Otherwise it's very good.,1
Awesome for the children to stay connected while school is closed. We have class meetings twice a week and absolutely love it.,2

It's like almost a 1/4 of a gig I need this for my work so I can't delete it. Please lower the storage needed,0
Is there any option to record the screen video or meeting recording in at least pro version,1
"This app could have a lot of functionality as a 'companion app' to my desktop computer. It would be excellent to automatically call into the meeting from my cellphone (including my user ID), for example. It would be good to be able to text others from my phone during a meeting. CISCO is missing out on some easy to implement functions that can help us.",2
"I really love the idea of this service! It is by far the easiest/highest quality service out there. The only thing that would make it better would be the ability to compleetly full-screen the video of the other person so that nothing covers any part of it. This would be esspecially useful if the other person is sharing their computer's screen. Currently part of their screen is covered/cut off. It would be great to see just their screen and nothing else. Otherwise, great app & superb service. Keep it up!",2

Not working in OnePlus 6 latest OS version since an year. No one bothered about it from Google making their apps cross device compatible and stable. ..............

Very poor standards.,0

Works well enough for what it is but it often glitches and cuts audio or video (sometines both). No extra functions and meetings are limited to 50 minutes unless you pay. I'd recommend the Teams app over Webex if you are having longer calls regularly.,0
Even after entering all the details correctly number of times it was displaying error msg ' plz check the details entered' and it never logged in,0
Great my Mother and me never miss our meetings.,2
"3 out of 5 times, when I connect to gotomeeting, the audio doesn't work. I am not able to hear what others in the call are saying nor they can hear my. My phone suddenly hangs when the call starts. Not sure if it's something about the phone. I use a vivo v17 phone. Please help",0

Hoping that you will also add the background feature on android devices.,1
Very slow and buggy. Logs you out mid-use (like while typing a message). Will not sync on it's own and takes a while when you force-sync. Will not update your status in the app. Not very useful at all. Previous comments were from January 2021. Update as of December 2021: still sucks. Literally haven't fixed anything.,0
When i join a zoom meeting I can't join audios. Like this one time our school had meeting and then I can't join audio. Please fix this,0
"Not user friendly. Presentation materials not easily linkable/presentable. Audio quality needs to improve significantly. Overall, not as good as Zoom or Google meets.",1
I could not even start the application. When you ask for help you get a mindless bot that keeps saying I don't understand the question. Then it just spews out irrelevant information. Will be Uninstaller because there is no way to resolve the issue. Extremely frustrating experience.,0
connection poor. Interrupted one time; voice not clear with chopped pause.,1

"Can't copy paste code. You have to share the file. It's painful when it's just two or three lines. It won't run in Linux due to weird character encoding when it goes through teams. Also takes ALL of your memory. Slows dowm devices so much it's ridiculous. On top of that, it has the annoying 'never go away even when you click the x' functionality like Skype. You have to right click, quit, then 10 seconds later, do it again, and THEN it quits. Mobile isn't garbage, but desktop just makes it unusabl",0
Wow very nicc,2

Zoom is a great platform for personal trainings without music. I'm glad I had it for the pandemic. 4 star only because I feel the storage is low when you are paying for a service. Also a way to sync music would be a huge help.,2

Nice improvements,2
But my classes,1
Application is good and easy to use but it would have been better: 1. If you had added multiple audio options because i can't use this application with my Bluetooth audio device. 2. Also it should be one button to go to chat so that one could easily navigate to chat and meeting.(Chat with Everyone),2
Make me happy,1
"Update 5.8.6 (3139) does not work on phones, nor tablets. And there was no warning. Before this any device could access Zoom. Now it became a huge inconvenience. A deterrent. Please fix it.",0

"1. Basic feature like microphone and loudspeaker sync is missing. You can enjoy meeting if it's connected to earphones, if you are using external speakers feedback occurs.

Its heavy on mid-range and even in some good config Mac, PC and Android devices.",0
"I HAVE to grant the camera permission now? I'm not going to use it, why do I HAVE to grant it? This is against Google play policies. You are violating them. Change this. I'm an Android developer, I know. Also there's no sound when muting and unmuting myself now? That's terrible design.",0

Very poor quality Audio not heard,0
This app is better than other video conferencing app bcoz in this the operator who arrange the meeting do not want to accept the request of other persons who wants to attend the meeting so time is not wasted to add the persons in the meeting.,1

"I dial in with my cell phone, continue working/multitasking on laptop, and want to be able to open the app on my tablet and  leave it open to see who is speaking, monitor, record, mute, et cetera.  The app won't do that though.  It prompts me to dial in using Skype, and won't bypass to let me into the conference.  On the web interface, you can do so, by telling the system that you have already dialed in.  This kills the app's functionality. I love the overall service (I am a premium subscriber)",0

"Every update since (and including) making this a separate app from hangouts has made this relatively simple chat program worse. It worked great when it was all in hangouts, but now it is constantly struggling to stay connected while timing out the meeting to entice someone to now pay money to use a worse version of every other chat program out there. Swing and a miss, Google. The only thing this program had going for it was being free.",0
It takes a lot of time to load and is very slow. Though the features of the app are amazing it could be better.,1

"When the pandemic was in full escalation and eruption, this app helped me to not only stay in touch with my loved ones, could help me maintain my sobriety.

Good meeting app,2
"I like the app and it really helps accomplish the necessary things that need to be done during covid-19 however however there's a lot of interference with other ppl having slow or no connections, I'm sitting next to my WiFi router and it kicks me off quite a bit. Few bugs to work out to make it to be as good as zoom....",0
Very useful...much better than Zoom and Googlemeet...but rarely used in India,2
"When I'm in on private meeting, the Zoom itself just neither quit or end my meeting while I minimize to check something else. It's not very clear why Zoom App just do that.",0
Excellent app very easy to set up and to use .The quality of sound and picture was extremely good with no hiccups at all .I have used this several times and would definitely recommend it to anyone that has the need to use a tool like this .Very well done I will defo use again .,2
"When I try to join the meeting , some other user with the same name is in the meeting and wierd movie sounds were coming from that user ( only from my username ) can you tell me what might be the problem",1
"Whole experience is awful, clunky and poor quality. Only supports chrome for vweb meetings but not chrome on android. The app itself is unpleasent and all we had was current sdpeaker which just flashed up everyone in sequence",0
"Dialpad Meetings (fka UberConference) is easy to use and effective as a teleconferencing tool. Disappointing that they failed to send UberConference users a notification regarding the changes, both the substantive ones and the surprising decision to ""abandon"" the clever brand name of UberC.

The option to switch role of presenter & host didn't work from the app. I still had to log into my computer in order to switch the roles.,0

"For those who are stucked with the never ending loop of single log in. Follow this simple trick. After you are able to sign in and authenticate your email and says open with App. Click on open with App and if the loop of open with App still coming on, just copy the link to another browser. For instance,if you are using Opera initially,just copy and paste the link on the opera to Google Chrome and you can then have option of open with the App itself. I hope this help someone.✌️✌️",2

The zoom app is the best but I gave it two star because the profile picture doesn't work at all. It doesn't work at all when I want to change the profile picture. Please develop this app.,0
The app is extremely slow on Android devices. The worst part is that it slowed down the rest of my phone and apps. Once I removed it ... My phone was like a breath of fresh air! I installed it again ... And it seems to be doing ok for now ... Hence the 2 stars. If the app brings my phone down again ... I will ask Google to allow negative rating on the app Store.,0
Absorbing high internet,0
"This is a great app and retired for work, but it forced me to buy a seriously upgraded phone because it brought my old phone, which ran fine without problems, to its knees once I installed it. in other words, it's a resource hog. It works well, is a great tool that is very useful for me, but comes at a great cost resource and phone functionality-wise.",1
Great for conferences,2

"When I was a child, and my family visited Epcot at Disney World, we were amazed and entertained to see the fantasized depictions of what technological advances would be like in people's homes in the future.

ZOOM (which was introduced to me just after the onset of Covid19 in the Spring of 2020) has blown my mind! That once fictitious, childhood fantasy of having ""phonavision"" is now commonplace.",2

Please add the pin option. (Only the host can pin message, and message will not gone and new people that enter the meeting will see the link)",0
"This is a really good app . But I gave it 4 stars cuz when my teacher presents their screen to teach us , I can see the screen but some of the screen is blocked cuz of my profile pic on down - right . And hence I can't see their screen presenting properly . I would like it if my profile pic would not appear while I view someone's presentation so that I can see their presentation clearly . Otherwise this is a great app and really easy to use .",2

"for the most part, pretty intuitive. if you regularly mute on/off take care because other activities on the phone, such as receiving an incoming call can move you off the webex screen making it a bit of a scramble to find the mute button in the interim. Developers, if you are listening, having a preference option to kick on do not disturb to the phone when incoming call happens (or allow for auto response from corner of screen) would be ideal.",2
"The app has become much more stable over the last two years but is still lacking in some nice to have features. While it is a bit clunky being able to stay in a meeting, running picture in picture mode is nice while being able to chat on the side with colleagues. But the two biggest drags on the app is no support to cast a meeting and no support for Samsung DEX mode. In DEX there is no ability to full screen a meeting or even make the window bigger nor the ability to use connected mic/speakers.",1

"Process of login thru the phone could be a lot better. For security reasons in Android this App is usually installed in the ""Work area"", then nothing can be copied from there.

"I changed my review because after contacting the developer & learning that this app is designed for voice only and not music, i felt it fair to give a better rating on that part. A mans voice is better heard than a femnish voice. Thanks for contacting me.🙂",2
Good but one major bug is if you leave a place and an account is no longer valid you can't just remove it. It keeps asking you to log on. You have to uninstall then add back other accounts. Very annoying.,1

Don't love Go to meeting...Zoom seems to be much easier to use,0
"It's a good app, easy to use.It uses less internet data compare to other similar ones. But it would be an add-on if it had voice with video sharing.",2
The app itself is acceptable for what it is used for in my company. However the quality of sound is something that needs to be improved. Way too many times people speaking or interrupted by static or simply cut off. If This Were to be fit I would change my rating to a five,1

Some how,1
"The Google meet is making it tough for me to take classes on the phone. It keeps leaving the meeting on my behalf on its own during the break period and then doesn't allow me to rejoin the meeting at all always showing the notification "" couldn't connect you to the video call"". It's super frustrating. I request Google to fix this as quick as applicable.",1
"I don't understand why they need that notification about who leaves and who joins, it hides the lower part of chat and in a meet with more than 100 people that means you're never going to see the last message. It's not even accurate, it would say people left when they didn't truly, maybe becaus of internet problems. Otherwise its very useful, many thanks to the team.",0

They gave me the link to enter the call on the webex app on my personal phone, but it didn't work. When l attempted to enter the call on the ""Brave Browser"", it (the link) worked perfectly.

Sometimes it will get stuck and also the buttons would not come in. in tab the virtual background will not come other than that everything good. You need to also support virtual backgrounds in every device because they may have programs so they need to keep background etc...,1
This app is just disgusting huhh It's just showing preparing meetings and i waited for too long time but nothing happened. everytime when i want to join a meeting it doesn't work atall i also update the app. My teacher shouted at me because i didn't join meetings. I really disappointed 😞,0
"App is perfect right now to my needs. 3 stars to get attention that the PC app isn't as good as this one! 1. Unlike this app, the windows app cannot switch accounts from one organization Teams to another's. Must sign out and sign in each time. 2. The special sharing option of ""Windows whiteboard"" is terribly glitchy and guests can't see it. But it works when I open windows whiteboard from the taskbar, then share the window like any window.

"Not the best, but it worked until more people joined the meeting. Working from home during the isolation. I was not able to participate in a meeting with 60+ members.

This by far the worst app I've ever used for communicating. 9 times out 10 calls don't go through or if they do 1 of the parties can't hear or be heard. Might as well just call them from your phone normally. Dont waste your time with this app,0

"I like this app for any meetings or online classes also, but this app doesn't allow me to change my background i.e. using virtual background/blur on my android mobile phone named ASUS ZENFONE MAX PRO M2 with android pie OS. It also doesn't allow me to use blur background feature on my laptop intel core i3 3rd gen. I can use blur background on my laptop in google meet and ms teams but not on zoom. Its my request to zoom tech team, Please just read my problem and try to resolve it fastly . Thanks",1
Explanations of what to do were very poor.,2
"Can't log in, constant server error",0

Very helpful for teaching.. App is nice but team has to work on meeting schedule system. We have to set meeting schedule everyday which is time consuming. There should be a system with which schedule can be repeated,2

I have cleared the cache, data, reinstalled, and yet the bug's still remained. I'm not always near or in the area of my desktop table, so I often rely on my phone and it's such a hassle to not be able to see the file and has to go manually in chrome. I have no problems with my wifi connection whatsoever, and I really do hope you fix this bug immediately.",0

"Hello ! Please add some filters / backgrounds and that can access to every kind of phone / brand. only a few people can update it because of their brand new phones, but what about those with old brand phones? someone like me who has a really bad anxiety and so insecure about myself, I want to at least look presentable with some simple filters..?? please update it :) also comments on chatbox, we can't delete it even though it's just a mistake or misspelled and some teachers take it seriously.",1

The app is good but it's often not responding. It is the only issue while attending some important meetings. Otherwise it's a great app. It would be better if the issue is considered important and get resolved. So that it can provide users a pleasant experience.,1

Are you serious? Now I have to sign in/up just to join a room? I've been a huge fan of AppearIn specifically because you didn't need to sign up or download anything. Now that's gone. Deleting and installing an older version instead immediately. UPDATE: Aug 2019 - Still makes you log in to just join a room. Why? Why? Why?,0

I am new to this app but I think it looks great,2
Agree with below sentiments.   Used to be awesome but has fallen off in recent months.   Cannot create new calls or create new contacts which was 99% of the reason I used the app.,0
"This is over all an excellent communication tool. However, it has an enormous flaw! Not being able to hear videos or discussions if you turn your screen(not video)off while they're video sharing. Hated this flaw even before I had to get gas while on a very long commute when I put my phone in my pocket, the screen touched the inside lining and unmuted me, interrupting a very important conference video for almost 3mins! Then texts poured in informing me of the disruption! PLEASE fix this!!!",0
"It doesn't support Bluetooth headset, so the sound can be direct outputted via the phone speaker instead. Is there any way to fix this issue ?",0

"After the last update I'm having the same flashing/loading screen issue as others have mentioned. I do find that turning off wifi & mobile data for 20sec and then renabling them temporarily fixed the issue. But it happens again at some point. Also have the login (bad network) issue that is ""solved"" by restarting my phone...but again, it comes back. This is a very poor app on android right now.",0

On my next occasion, I gave up on the Pixel Buds, but when my Pixel 4 slept, I could not wake it. Teams kept popping up and putting it back to sleep, and I wasn't fast enough to interrupt the process. If I can't depend on it then I won't use it, too much at stake.",0

pretty cool. saves time and they get to know you before hand so you can literally do one in your pajamas like I just did.

Hey you need to keep virtual background option for Android users. Virtual background runs efficiently in android because tablets and phones may have High definition camera. You can even keep filters in zoom Android version like zoom windows version. You can even develop audio and video settings in zoom for Android. You can keep different options like use snap chat cam use secondary cam filters etc for zoom Android users. You can keep share only computer audio for zoom Android users.,1
This is very nice app for chating Or learning,0
Why google met when the host leaves the meeting why we get out of meet. We can't talk with friends after the host leaves. World worst feature.,0

Teams is a nice app and is free to use.sonetimes updates and gives you issues and everytime u have to login to use it. The only problem is that in windows seven you can have a virtual background,2
Makes working on the go really easy. Would like it if you could screen share on an Android mobile device without it taking over everything. It makes demoing mobile development nearly impossible.,2

"I always feel like MS decided to try to make a Slack and a Zoom competitor and mash them into one epic ""at least you tried"" effort. Sitting in a Teams meeting today on mobile and seeing every half second announcements of ""We're recording!"" & ""We're transcribing!"" Dear MS - once I ""X"" it out and acknowledge it, that's a pretty solid indicator I don't want to see it anymore. Your UI is annoying. Your functionality is less than. But the corporate overlords require its use. So you have that I guess.",1

This app was pretty helpful. I saw my professor during this pandemic and it really gave me some motivation to get the work done by any means. The video quality was good. The only thing is that on Samsung devices you may not see everyone that's in the chat but that's alright because it automatically goes to the person that is talking it sometimes that takes a minute.,2
Good to used,1
the features are amazing and easy to use but if you have an old busy phone then it may hang sometimes but If your phone is not soo old(5yrs)then uts good the features are better on a PC or laptop . if you use a PC then to use it in phone might make your screen feel overcrowded .it's best for the online classes as the pendamic has created so much of problems.🙏🙏🙏,2

Thousands of people are already using and are benifited by this app. Especially during the pandemic period, to take on line class, both the Trainer and the recipient are benifited by this. I once again thank Google for such a great help for free. Thankyou.",2

"Had no sound visual was okay, don't know if this instructor notice my comments in the chat. Only one person through hand gestures we both knew we could not hear the instructor don't know about any other people who are in the class. Also play with it to see maybe it was on my hand to see if it was a mute button but did not see one that could be unmuted overall as far as connection there was no problems just a problem of not being able to hear the instructor other than that morningstar's my choice",0

I really like this app,2
"Self explanatory and very easy to use, free, good video quality, and I can't recall seeing any ads, or if their was their was hardly any. I definitely think it's worth having on your phone!!!",2
i could not see my background wallpaper icon iam many times reports for Google meet next time I will put many reasons please find out 😠😠,1
This app is absolute trash it's made me reset my password 2 times in a row and asked me yet again to change my password trying to get it setup for an important work meeting that I cannot miss tomorrow morning and it will not let me log in properly. My advice to any company....find a better #@$%^%$ option than this absolute trash. Skype is a better option. Not surprising it's trash when it's developed by Microsoft who as a company has a habit of releasing products 3-4 years before bugs are fixed,0
"Hot Garbage. I had to install this on my phone since I had a Teams meeting, but had to be on the server room floor. Installed the app, logged into the cooperate account, it sees the meeting invite in its' calendar, but I can't join the meeting. From Outlook app, I open the meeting, click the link to join and it opens the browser were I can download the app or open the app. Click the link to open the app and nothing happens.",0
I am rating this app 1 star because whenever I in a meeting I automatically get removed and when I don't get removed I can't hear others audio and video I can't even see them present their work.,0

Amazing app,0
"Sound at the beginning kept cutting out. Had already registered for the webinar, downloaded the app in advance, and used the link sent, but still ended up having to re-register to gain access. Difficult to move speaker screen around. Messages kept popping up on speaker's shared screen, and sideshow kept timing out so we'd end up seeing a screensaver.",0

"I can video call fine which is what it is used for. However, I use a phone with desktop mode as my pc, and using the android version of Zoom has some serious shortcomings. You can't use gallery view. It shows a screen with 4 participants at a time and you have to scroll between screens to see the different participants. Also I cannot use my phone on its side to have landscape camera. I tried with auto rotation on my phone and it just showed my screen sideways in portrait",1
"Ignore the idiots. This app does what's needed. You can either have an account created if your employer has admin access to the cloud console, or simply sign in as guest - all you need is the meeting/end point extension number. End of story.",2

"If signed out, say over a weekend, the app keeps opening itself full-screen so I constantly have to close it every time I go to use my phone. This is beyond annoying. If I'm not using your application I do not want it open, it's that simple. I'm sure you want all the analytics and data you can get off of me, but if I'm opting out don't force it open again. And setting my ""status"" to away doesn't stop colleagues in Europe from messaging me at 3am on a Monday.",0

"I Installed this on my WiFi Nexus 7 tablet but then quickly uninstalled due to the fact that this app will only support connecting by using paid Skype credit (or a 'Mobile Data' option, which did not work on my Nexus).

Auto connection unstable most of the time.,0
Mobile Use: Whenever someone signs on/leaves you'll get a msg with the name of the participants which covers the speaker's face. It would be nice to have a feature that allows you to see the speaker only & not participants. The only time I was able to see only the speaker was when I was in a doctor/patient meeting.

The app is not working anymore it shows only white screen. Its been 4 days and nothing changes.,0
Good,2
Sound problem,1
love it,2
good,1
New trying to learn the system..,0
Easy to use application. Could benefit from some raiser features to make lessons more interactive,1
"Horrible. When I'm supposed to be logged in as guest it tries me to log in with a corporate account, which I don't have.",0
"We use it for work. It's stable and consistent and the platform is very flexible. If you find you are not enjoying the experience, it's probably your system administrator's fault 🤣",2
Great,2
It's a good tool but at times it crashes and takes more time to restart. Crashing in the middle of meeting is embarrassing.,1
Teams app is best platform of line in,1
"App is good for classes, but whenever I use it on mobile it completely hangs and even I m not able to unmute or leave the meeting. This is continuously happening from last month.",0
Cannot switch to phone speaker like a normal app.,0
Really great app for holding meetings online,2
Zoom is great but I wish android version had better gallery view of participants when there are more than 4 participants. I wish active speaker would show on gallery view on the first pages of participants so you can see who's talking.,1
Not bad,1
Useful,1
Amazing ap. As a Project Manager I use it for my calls. I love how it calls you.,2
It won't work for me,1
"Great app for online classes, unlike an app that's name is based on a binocular's feature.",2
"Clear audio, limited network glitches and doesn't limit the number of people connecting",2
Help,2
This apps is the best for my work life,1
There are many problems in this app 1 It drains battery really fast 2 During the full screen the presentation behind the slide that shows my status like is my Mike on\off or my video is on\off is not visible 3 when other people leave or join we can't access three dot option because the notification which off people leaving and join comes between,0
The problem is I can't hear nothing while I can see the screen !!!!,0
I have installing the app but it is not installing there was written pending it take 10 hour then also written pending my ping was very good,0
"Nice app, works good. Easy to join meeting with single click and its integration with outlook makes it easy to send invitations and view calendar from the app.",2
Ok,2
It is better,0
They have built a good video conferencing App. One of my friends told me about it as I got a text message to join a meeting and since then I have been using it myself.,2
The biggest,2
Good app.,2
Was difficult to connect. Kept saying cannot connect to meeting. Finally after 3rd try it worked.,1
This app actually good,2
Great app but this means school at home😁,2
We want estes skin 😤,0
nice app,2
Overall experience with this app is good but from four five days it is creating problems in viewing pdf files under assignment. Please fix the problem,2
A very appropriate app for our purposes. Satisfied.,2
Difficult to bluetooth to speaker while casting to tv screen.,0
Video cuts out constantly even with 5g wifi and full bars. And you can't turn the video off on presentations hosted by others.,0
Works so well on my phone I can survive a laptop crash or connectivity issue and still make my meetings. Seamless transition from phone to laptop.,2
"I hv been using it for a long period of time. It's very much useful for students and other institutions while it has some issues to be fixed , on every update it logs me out and I hv to sign in again, it also shows a pharse for long and I can't see what's happening in my account.",1
"Great audio/visual. All around, no problems - although I wasn't clear on how to interact from my end (chat).",2
"for the new update for tablet, it would be really nice if the chat option would be easily available on the toolbar instead of having to go to the three dots to get the in-meeting chat option. And also it would've been great if the in-meeting chat wouldn't have taken up the whole screen for those with big screens, i.e, tablets.",1
It's great because it's free and it works well!,2
"Nice of course, zoom helped us connecting during covid 19 pandemic. Only it should increase the meeting time without pay version like google meet... They can think.. Otherwise I am quite happy with it.",2
Vidéo mettings are get to much internet 😅,1
"Good system for remote training. Does require a stable internet connection. Cell reception in Colton, CA made the meeting choppy but still a valuable experience.",2
It was a good experience here rather than using zoom or any other i suggest you using this AAP,2
Nice app only but I don't have baground .,1
Nice,2
"No video, just audio.",0
Resound,0
👍👍,1
Good,2
It's a amazing app we get alot of help from teams and we can also chat but some times my mobile gets hang and no class links open,1
This browser is very much helpful and easier to handle and demands comparatively less strong internet. So I think this will make a very familiar and interactive meeting for the users.,0
Some meeting connect in own network It was work in WiFi,0
This app is not able to down loading. Gone through the play store Clicked The app but not been downloaded What r the reason Srikant,1
It does not respond on phone.....I would choose to use on laptop. Need to improve connection problems.,0
Was a great one and no ads shown,2
"Worked well on the fly. Had to download and jump into a meeting asap. Great app so far, so good.",2
Without 4200 can't Concentration on work,0
Very bad app. Again and again asking to update. If possible I would love to submit 0 stars.,0
"Very easy and perfect free conference app. Thumbs up for sure. Love the hold music, very funny. Like the text reminders too.",2
"Good for being able to focus on the participant who is currently speaking, but it is difficult to figure out the sound settings and how to enable others to see you.",2
Great video and audio,2
I am trying to download but play store don't approved for installation. So I do not installed the app. Please help me for installation,0
If I can give you a (zero) star I would love to. I have been receiving invalid activation codes from you. It's almost 1 week since my company sent me my workplace log in details but I haven't successfully opened it yet because all the activation codes that was sent to me is invalid. I think you don't want me to use your app. It's so sad because I really need to work immediately but your app disappoints me .,0
Thanks for the best conference app ever.,2
Searching for stuff in chats is a bit difficult.. otherwise Teams is a good Microsoft feature,2

"terrific method for maintaining and generating team engagement, recognition and communication.",2
Now I think it's nice but I don't think is there is an option for background on tablets if it will come then this app will deserves full stars...,2
Notifications have stopped working so now nothing comes up until you go into the app. I've missed some key things because of this.,0

Most professional meeting aap,2
It is a nice software to meet and chat with people. But Im not able to share my screen in the tablet and there are not many options like keeping video filters. Thats the issue I've so overall I like it. Its a good software.,1
Good clearity.sound ok.,1
"My video was displayed sideways on my interlocutor's screen, and my video kept dropping several times (I had to click on the video icon again). Also, the call crashed at some point as well. Overall a frustrating experience. I have a very fast internet connection (300 Mb/s).",0
"Generally good design, just buggy at times with MS rolling changes too quickly or having other infrastructure issues. They need better QA",2
"Blessed Day, please allow all phone users, especially Android users, to use a virtual background because I cannot focus on the discussion because my background is messy. Thank you so much, and God bless. Please consider my suggestion if it is alright.",0
Unable to connect from my mobile app. Still browser loads okay. Will give 5 star if this bug fixes,0
It is not connecting to the network at the tym of rain use ful app,1

I've used TEAMS in several different environments. It has always worked well! A good UX!,2
Its vry nice I can able to create linkand send to meeting clients there is some amount of problem beacuse of network issue.,2
I updated the app on android but there is no background. But my friend updated the app and they got background on android!!!,2
Fine,2
Have never had a problem using this app. Pretty straightforward.,2
Cant even open it with a link keeps telling me to log in with my account but when i do it says no account with that email..... zoom better,0
Great interface..however some more customisability with the HUD would be great e.g. different views. Multiple speaker views. More flexibility with split screen view on Mac,2
"Works, but sketchy at times. From a phone, you can only see one person, besides yourself, like why do I need to see myself? You're supposed to see the speaker, but lag is so bad at times, their picture never makes it for other members popping in first because they dont understand the importance of muting your own mike. All that added to saturated bandwidth makes for barely useable meeting.",1
Sometimes cannot get in to a meeting. Often get an echo on all voices.,2
Good app. But my profile (and other profiles when I go on there) is not loading for me. The thing just keeps spinning not loading and I can't see what I post on my profile. Fix ASAP,1
Good app but I cannot see the chat box why ?,2
Good,2
"Cannot see a I've speai, except by chance. Cannot see all of participants. The once leader, is now badly behind.",0
Volume always seems to be distorted where the speaker's mouth movements don't match the words. The other issue is the visual quality doesn't seem to be as sharp as other applications,1
"The experience using this app on the phone is horrible. First, it asks for your work email id, opens the app and then asks you to choose from the email ids and goes back to step 1. Great work, Facebook.",0
Realy nyc app,2
It's a nice app! I use it for my online classes. But sometimes the audio just turns off and I can't hear my teacher or classmates. And then i have to leave and come back or disconnect audio. Please fix this. It's a big issue,1

"It is not a good app , doesn't connect to e Server . Doesn't deserve even one star . It has made a routine of not connecting . I have a lot of issues with webex when i am attending online classes sometimes i can't connect to audio ,the screen get blank .

"App is good but we can't do much custumisation like voice filter, custumize the meet according to our data usage. I know meet has an option of less data consuming but we want to custumize meet. And impruvement is needed in order of voice enhasing",2
Reasonably simple to use. Camera angle is unfortunately restricted by the device being used. All up a good product.,2
No update in Background..,0
Easy to use for the gs to thats good!! Kiss affect you know keep ot simple s word yoi know the word!!! Some interruptions the way cookie crumbles have to adapt figure it out be smart,2

"Such an amazing app to interact people , can be used for education, professionally and business purpose and client meetings...6 Star ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",2
Your teams app looks good and it so damn advanced but I wanted to download the profile photo of someone else but you have removed that feature from teams and I was so much aggrieved with that as it was important,1
This is not opening in desktop,1
Good 👍🌻👌,1
Where is hand raise option in Indian server,1
It keeps error after i upgraded my plan from basic to pro. It sucks!!!,0

Forever for audio to work,1
Pathetic app. Unnecessarily says that there is no internet although it is there. It also takes really long to load and glitches a lot. Too many ubdates disturb its performance.,0

Zoom is the best way to online mitting so please are goodnes of things,1

Nice application,1
"Notifications say ""please log in to Workplace to continue getting.."", even though I'm logged in, and clicking the notification does not take me to the actual content.",1
can't get past emails. very disappointed.,0
"Well, its kinda good. But could be better from my opinion. We do classes in google meet and that is actually way better. They can make some updates and changes.",0
It is a good app but it always says that it ran into an problem and it takes 5 to 10 minutes to recover it,1
Great app to be in touch with team using both desktop and mobile version. I was thinking why Reply option is not available in Desktop version and in Mobile version alone. Recently it has been added to Desktop version and really a great feature...,2
I use this app for my doctor and counseling appointments right now during the COVID-19 pandemic,2
Hữu ích,2
Good app.,1
"Buggy, bad sound and picture quality even over great wifi or reception. Fails a lot. Sadly a few companies work only with Teams and not with Zoom",0
It simply means that voice is getting blocked or error has come in meeting .This not a good for online classes very poor condition Solve it,0
It is a good app but it always says that it ran into an problem and it takes 5 to 10 minutes to recover it,1
The new update is just not as good as the previous version.....even when pinned the person's screen is not fully visible,1
App,1
ok no hustle,2
"All features working properly using dekstop App. But, disappointed with mobile app such as background filter not working for attendee as we launch webinar. Also, we are good to see spotlight scheme when going live, but recorded webinar only show some grid & also not all user included in frame.",1
After the new update it doesn't work properly it has so many bugs .I think the older version is better than the new one.,0
There are some glitches but it is overall very good.,1
"The voice quality in the call-me feature is not good. Also there should be an option available for the user in the ""i will call in"" option to enter a number of his choosing (eg. A toll free number )",1
Good one,2
Ok ok but not the best,2
"Attendees were friendly and tried to help, and the host Delena was very understanding and helpful as well.",2
Very good,2
"Super difficult to rejoin a standing meeting as you have to look again for ID and password or save to clipboard. Web links only work half the time, otherwise stalls. Issues connecting to Bluetooth if joining without video.",0
Goov,1
Horrible meeting app.. keeps on crashing and throwing me out of the meeting. There are better alternatives like Google Meet or zoom,0
Amazing experience,2
App is easy to use. Be nice if it somehow warned you that the sign on expired and will be required BEFORE you need to do the 4 steps to sign on which usually happens when you are trying to get on a meeting and thus delays you. If using a mobile phone obviously convenience is important and this does not make it convenient.,1
Videos of students in my class are blurred and the mic doesn't work properly. That's why I'll give only 1 star.,0
I am like this app,1

"I can't say if this app is good because from the look of things is bad , after registration I've been waiting for my code to verify my number yet it has not been sent. Is been over 4 days now. Still nothing. As a new user this doesn't tell well of you. Please do something.",0

Sign in kept looping back over and over again . Had to sign in as a guest. Closed caption was not accurate at times. Otherwise it worked great.,1
Great.,2
If normal call comes in the background it the volume of the WebEx call gets changed . Not very easy to use for elderly,1

Got a warning from carrier that teams is causing problems with 911 calls. Wow. Uninstalled.,0

"Unable to increase volume so I could hear easily. Does not happen with other apps. Content was good, just had to strain to hear.",0
ok,1
♥♥♥❌,2
Provides essential functions with clean interface and always works flawlessly. Only negative is the awful hold music.,2
A beautiful world and not only a beautiful workplace.,2
Wo woo Ha so wo,2
Yes it is clear,0
"Two stars for it connecting a couple people together, but honestly the experience was pretty bad. Volume levels spiked and dropped randomly, people would suddenly be muted for no reason, the video feed kept resizing and mostly disappearing off the side of the screen, no option to switch camera, and controls felt very clunky. It does work, mostly, but there are much better options out there.",0
"Sometimes when I open the app, it shows ""teams isn't responding"" and it is not really my device's problem, because same thing happens in my sister's device also. Please fix this issue. And it's really weird that even though my WiFi networks are working okay, there is still network issue.. Also please let me see the recordings of meetings,which I am not able to see. This app really needs improvement, other than that, it's a pretty good app to connect with your friends and family.",1
"It's Very much useful for today. For online classes, meeting, meeting family members together and much more.",2
DIFFICULT to get On..but the host didn't give correct meeting ID and password in advance? The audio had a LOT of interferance that we could not get rid of...,0
Worst app,0
Terrible call quality on calls with over 4 people. Screen sharing completely unusable. Refused to let me out of contract despite being unable to meet the terms of service they promise. Our company changed to another service and we no longer have issues.,0
hope its good,2
Zoom is better by a landfall and a bonus check. Might change my review later.,0
Mofos delete this application before my college start taking online classes,1
Having a very bad prob with my meet's camera idk what happened but suddenly it just blinked one time and became darken and whenever i used my camera it looks the same as black black but whenever i am in very brightening place like being in sunlight or infront of any blub it looks normal otherwise it looks darken all my side i dont whats going on i request to solve this prob as soon as possible,1
I am trying to import photographs to use his backgrounds during a zoo meeting I can't do that period I don't know why or if it's the type of format on the photograph that I want to use but it will not let me import photographs..

Really good quality video experience. Easy to navigate.,2
"Fantastic app and conferencing service, I've used it for years",2
I can not add my mobile contacts to zoom every time I try it says put correct mobile number but I used the correct one all the time,0
Crashes as soon as I open the app,0
Nice App,2
"The apps fairly okay, it does what it says and the system of getting in and out of meetings is well done. However, not only are there many many glitches with basically every aspect of the app but it also super heats any device that runs it. After just a hour long meeting my phone feels like fire and I can't open the camra app. This cannot be good for my phone. I don't know if this issue is fixable or not, maybe running lots of cameras at once is to hard but it's at least worth mentioning.",0
Inconsistent. Unable to share camera as presenter and attendee unable to share camera. Have used twice before same attendee with camera fine. What's up.,0
Very good app,2
Can't find a way to select the rear camera anymore.,0
Very useless app🤬🤢,0

Simple features..easy to use.. just a bit unstable for background image..really like it..,2
"So unreliable. Update! Reliability is still terrible, but now the Android app audio is bipolar - and loves to whisper. Would be good on a date with a hot girl but doesn't work so well when trying to do your day job. Great job Cisco. You just keep rolling out the hits.",0
Not very good,0
Android app sucks. Does not work!,0

Excellent. Sometimes it breaks up but that maybe due to internet connection.,2
Very nice👍👍👍👍👍,2
I liked it very much for its easy accessability,2
Very complicating. Difficult to join in.,0
Awful application...took forever to download and the sound and quality is appalling...,0
Does not have an option to turn on the speaker.  I have to hold it to my ear to hear the meeting.  What? You didn't think of that? We spend too much on this system to have such a crap app.,0
"Chats don't load. I have tons of chats on the desktop app and yet when I open teams on my phone, chats is completely empty. Notifications don't work. App used to be great. Now, total useless garbage.",0
I always experienced audio interruption whenever I changed direction of my phone. Or about to multitask or minimizing the app.,0
"Content was good, I had trouble hearing at times, also my screen went dark the last 15 minutes. Possibly a problem with my device.",1
It is eating all my data 😤😤,0

Its qute pretty.but huge mb for downloding,2
"Should have a reply option, to a specific post as in Whats App..",1
I like it,1
Clunky and connection issues. Forced undismissable notification.  You have to force quit the app to get rid of it.  This all = a bad UX. Seems more like an alpha build to be honest.,1
Great app. Have used it to give tours of my new home to my friends. Great for meetings in general. It has a few things I would like to see done differently but all in all very functional and easy to use.,2
The app is nice but When I exit from the zoom only 1 minute only it runs in background. Plz fix it,0
The App works well but half way through artifact made listening difficult.,2

Waiting for Double-tap to like a post or update like you can in iOS. Have some trouble with seeing status of team members until after you message them. Org chart layouts just stink. Communications in real time are pretty good. Overall not a bad app. It is a decent app. Just needs some more work. I find that it doesn't sync fast enough with MS AD for status and pics.,1
Very good can communicate through spiritual brother and sister twice a week. Out conversation national and international . It is a great help for me and others,2
Video conference,2
So grateful for this super easy - to - use technology that is connecting millions of people during a pandemic. Thank you to the developers. ♡ Edit Dec 2021 Remains a 5 star experience with hundreds of meetings under my belt in 2021. THANK YOU!!!!!,2

"Sorry,after I did the update why did the raise hand feature disappear on my google meet. I hope for progress but what you give is a downgrade",2
"Why does my camera go off whenever I open a different tab, pleas fix this.",1
Worst app then before 2-3 months it was being to consumed 200-250 MBs for 1 and half hour but now it is consuming almost 700 for the given time. So disappointing 😒,0
Best conferencing app and service I've ever used. I immediately upgraded to a paid subscription after using. The ability to see who's on and  control the call is fantastic. I've been using for over a year without any problems.,2
It's a great communication app and all but I wish it wasn't always so glitchy and hard to understand who you're talking to I mean it was just hard to communicate in classes I had and stuff like that,1
Can't post a picture and a document together,1
Very good app clearity superb 👌,2
"Everytime I log in ... The app throw me out and say ""your session has ended please log in again"" I logged in for 5 times in row . I used this app for 2 years and this the first time to face this problem .",0
It takes a little bit of time to get used to but after that this is a great app! Meetings and sharing information could not be easier!,2
good,2
"I can easily make and receive calls, set up virtual meetings and even share my screen. Calls even work very well on not so great bandwidth conditions. Great complement to the Lifesize ecosystem.",2
I have given 4.0 stars because there is no option Of visual effects in my meet and I am using the latest version but the option of visual effect is not coming what is the solution of this problem.,2
Really good so far. Used for school. Small trouble zooming in to look at coding but that aside great use for project and such. Good zoom replacement for projects and such.,2

One of the worst apps for businesses and collaborators to get work done and share ideas. USPS mailing is more productive than this app. Won't even let me log in even though I changed my password and entered in correct password. Won't be using this app anymore.,0

This app causes many issue but it's almost medium good but the Cisco company works very much to improve it so it's almost nice,1

I am giving l star because one day when i joined a meet i cannot senn anyone and cannot see the presentation and also cannot hear any thing i would like to check the problem and fix it in the upcoming updates,0
"I'm amazed by how slow and unoptimized this app is. It's worse than both Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Audio keep stuttering when you turned on the camera, multiple videos are very slow to load, the focus mode has no zoom feature on it, the audio option shows call in, call me, and internet yet only internet works, clicking ""Chat with everyone"" requires multiple presses, audio delay is massive, and once you got disconnected, you have to enter the meet using the link again. There's no auto-reconnect.",0
In this app the mic is not working yet It is very hard while attending the online classes and another problem is while using this app I didn't use any other apps at a time,0

Stop working just like that,1
"I have a paid version. I need to unsubscribe now. Cannot at all find where to unsubscribe. I've sought technical support for other previous issues. No one got in touch with me. For some reason, I have found myself into another organisation's account and no longer have access to the Admin Console. I really don't know which company it is.",0
Connection was poor video kept fading in and out audio kept fading in and out and at one point it actually left the meeting,0
Sound is horrible all the time... don't forget to turn your speaker on!,1

I think the app actually works better than the online computer version. Pretty user friendly and good connectivity through a smartphone.,2
Dear microsoft teams is a really very good app until the latest update. After the latest update I am not able to open any type a document files assignment section. I hope a solution for this may come really very early. It is really very urgent,0
Horrible service. So tired of constant audio issues being blamed on android when the audio works everywhere else!,0

"This app is a disgrace in comparison to desktop experience, and a reason why I would recommend away from Uberconference, as its mobile experience is still quite poor. 3 main reasons: 1) I have to login somewhere to use it. No login of any kind is needed on Desktop, unless you are hosting. It's cumbersome. 2) Opening a conference link in the app does not take you to the conference.  You have to type the conference name in. At least if you had to login in the process. 3) May be there is VOIP support, may be there isn't (yes, I heard rumors there was). I didn't dare find out. The app gives you stern warnings that it needs your phone number, and it will dial in to the conference, which is assigned a US number. Providing the phone number is not an option, as well as not giving the app dialing permissions. I am abroad, I'm on roaming, I don't want to incur international voice charges. If there is a VOIP mode, then those at most should be optional, as I have no assurances that the phone won't dial me into the conferences, plus the app outright tells me it will. (this was expanded as original was typed up on the phone, right after the experience, and as a mean to reply to the Developer).",0
Had difficulty opening the link to this virtual doctor appointment. Not as easy to navigate as Google or others.,1
"Taking up spaces, not synching with desktop, unable to sort out messages, i have to find the latest message so downnnnn there near the bottom but not at the bottom, i hate it. Wasting my time and energy for just that one insignificant feature. simply confusing and made me missed loads of important events. If only i can uninstall it.",0

The floating bar which appears when we leave the screen. Is bugged it appears in the very corner of the screen and we can't bring it up.. when we touch it - it disappears,1
Zoom offers 40 minutes of meeting time for free with their basic membership. The basic membership with zoom is free. $0.00 and I still get 40 minutes continuously for free. That's enough for me.,1

Great but they are getting rid of the free option. Scrambling to find an alternative.,0
"Hey Google, This app is really good but one thing is really annoying for mobile users that, when I am in a meeting and my teacher is showing a presetation, my video floats over it and guards half part of the screen and I am not able to see it. I would be grateful if you fix that prblem😊",1
All the time it need to login and shows that u don't have account. Later on login with that account which I tried before.,0
"While this is a great app, it used to be way better before the update recently. The captions are slow to update and usually are very behind, you cannot kick anyone from the meeting anymore. That is the biggest problem now. I was in my class and someone joined on an account and none of us could kick him, and even worse they started playing vulgar music and pornography on the screen while presenting. The microphone has a load of echo as well. However the app is great with video and voice. Thanks!",0
It is a very good app. Just I would request a feature to switch between devices like in Zoom cloud without leaving the meet rather than leaving from one device and then joining from other device.,2
I had to attend virtual curriculum night while away from home. WebEx Android App made it possible to attend. I used cell data as I didn't have wifi and it worked perfectly!,2

"Completely non functional on Samsung Galaxy 9.. Audio does not work through Bluetooth, or not through Bluetooth.

"Lags heavily during any and all amount of usage - you'll waste so much time with trivial tasks such as going between channels and chats. Forces you to authenticate frequently with seemingly no root cause. When using the app on a computer, you will receive notifications on both your computer and phone. You cannot tag other users/groups programmatically with their notification card API. Overall, this is application is a pain to use and integrate with.",0
"3.5...Great when it works like it's supposed to, but really sucks when it doesn't!",1
Meet is an Amazing app but the only problem i am facing is in Meet the background and filters are not coming Can you tell me how to fix it.,2

I like this app it is useful too so I just recommend to download it it is nice.,2
Clarity is there,1
"• Bugs with floating window. • Sometimes while in floating window the entire original screen merge inside the floating window. • Sometimes the floating window shows as transparent. • And also the inbuilt report section is such a waste because we can't attach custom screenshots, it can only attach the screenshot taken by itself so I can't attach the screenshot of the problem with the floating window issues and etc.",1
I hate this app because it has lot of lacing problem,0
Hope that the background will be available again using mobile.,0
"Why you guys don't add a resolution option in the app which we use in mobile, every time i had to open crime change resolution to join a meeting. It's too annoying. We don't get change resolution option directly in the app, that's the reason the video consumes large amount of data or it we turn it off it will make the video blue😡😡",0

It keeps on getting me out of the meeting after i update it today i have important meeting today but i always got disconnected the when i came back it only says connecting and if i successfully join it will be disconnected after 10 mins how can I perform the given task to me. Please fix this problem.,0
"This is the best app to communicate while lockdown or some other issues. I have a question about this app, how can we update the app (in mobile)? I have tried to check it in the Play Store but I cannot find any ‘update' button. Looking forward from you for the answer. By the way, I have finished 2 long and fun years using this app!Thank you for this app 🙂",2
I have never had a problem with zoom at all but now it has kicked me out of my meetings so many times so hopefully this bug is fixed,0

"There are no ads in the app. It takes some getting used to, in order to work properly. It not the best to use on data or WiFi. It disconnects often. It is good for privacy and ease of access once you are on. You have to tweek each device if you transfer during a web meet. It ask questions if you are on during a web meet and your battery saver is on. It is good but it could be better.",1

I like the app and I want you to help me if you are interested in learning English to join my group appear.in/englishlearning  thank you in advance (only serious learners ),1
"i love the app. works flawlessly. the reasons i haven't given 5 stars is because of the 'XY is now speaking' bar. it usually covers content of the screen. plus, the phone doesn't enter full-screen mode in landscape mode in which the statusbar and navigation bar takes unnecessary space.",1
This app is fun to use I enjoy my Dr appointments on here lotaffe Lmaofff go lazenby,1
Very functional and useful app. UX can be improved. Crashes when switching between apps. Less responsive compared to competing apps.,1
Got late for meeting. Sign in error. 😐,1
From another phone unable to open,0
I don't know what the problem is with your app but most times it leaves me out of the group I can't hear anyone they can't hear me sometimes they can see me but it's choppy and all I see is the spinning loading bar circle and that's it and it's literally going to cost me like my probation so if you could just somehow I don't know make it not do that that'd be great,0
The app is very good for school and business purpose but after some time this app needs to log in again as I did not log out of it and then the all time this app only shows me showing your results and i always need to delete this app and re install this app . I need the Microsoft to resolve this issue for this app Thank you,1
Ok,1
Buggy: I've signed into work and personal accounts but when I'm switching from personal to work account I'm still seeing messages as unread in work account but they are already answered on desktop version. It's also showing as I've got notification from personal teams but there is no call miss or message.,1

"Status of all contacts and myself is showing white on my phone as well as Mac. It's showing my status as offline to others even when i was online today. And yes, i did reset the status. Other problems include, chats still show unread messages even when I read them on my desktop. Notifications arrive very late and disappear by themselves after few seconds. Not getting calls on phone app wether Teams is open on desktop or not. App is slow in general. Lottt of issues. Doesn't feel like MS product.",0
"The app would be handy to have, but cause it wont actually open the app after the single use sign in on the webpage, it is therefore almost pointless having installed. It just puts me in a loop, when I press the button to open app and continually opens more web browser windows of the same page. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S9. So unless you make some adjustments, it's pointless me having the app installed.",0

Not bad. But sometimes screen sharing doesn't synchronized from host to other people in the call. And usually our voice won't register when speaking with an on mic.,1
This is a really good app for my studies but . I am using a tablet. In tablets you can't change your background or it doesn't have the suggestion. Please fix this . Please let tablets to have backgrounds changing too.. other than that this app is perfect.. thank you hope you fix this,2
Not working for me,1
I didn't know such app even exists. It works good for the most part. We use it at least three times  day. It allows me to reach out to people's I never imagined reaching out to. I still give the app 5 stars. I've only have encountered one issue. At one point I was able to have my live conference and see who's calling in and who is speaking.  Now i get a error message. No complaints and will recommend it to other. Thanks,2
It's awesome I like it but atleast make it stable regardless of network,1

I like the app features but If I attending the Google meet I can't answer to another phone calls and I can't record screen and voice of the screen while meeting. Why? Please check out this problem.,1

"Great way to connect with family, friends, and colleagues! During this period of pandemic I have not lost any connections!",2
"When you open a team inside the desktop version, you can actually see that there are no meetings at the moment. But when you open a team in the app, you just see a 'join' button no matter if there's a current live meeting or not. That way people is fooled into joining a meeting, and, when they see that they're the only assistants and the meeting hasn't started yet, they get out of it. And it gets pretty annoying. Please make that join button less visible if those meetings have not yet started.",1
"Some of the videos were cutting out and also the adios, but that may have been the internet as well.",2

It's a very comfortable and simple app to use.,2
"The Android version of Teams is abysmal. You can't answer calls when the screen is locked, also applies to Bluetooth. If you have more than one account configured it confuses them and represents data from one in the other. If you need to depend on Teams to answer calls do not use this app, you will miss many calls and messages A rating of 1 is way too high. The Windows desktop app is way better, my only issue there is the flakiness of the remote control of a screen share",0

Better than desktop version. 1.

Without this feature...the call is recieved thru both instances causing confusion of which one to attend. Hanging up the call on mobile makes the call quality better on desktop.,2

"My nonprofit has been using Slack. It works well, especially when we're on-the-go, and access to a desktop or even a laptop isn't always an option. Unfortunately, the most useful features (calendar, tasks, documents) involve messy to manage add-ons. I thought the native integration of Teams with other Microsoft products would be perfect. Unfortunately, it turns out most of those integrations are buggy, especially on mobile. If only messaging is reliable, we might as well sick with Slack.",0

I love it. it's a great way to keep in the loop with the company,2

"Good system, allows you to interact with your friends and colleagues easily.",2
"So many bugs... Joining a meeting from a notification straight up just does nothing. Bluetooth headsets often just straight up don't even show up in the app. And ever since November 11 I am getting logged out every 24-48 hours. Chat notifications keep coming in, then I tap one and get my org's MFA login screen. This is particularly scary with the recent 9-1-1 bug that only occurs if Teams is logged out. It's a shame this app was released by such a small tech startup that can't afford QA.",0
"This app is good but the new update has a problem that we can't copy and select anything from the chat section, please fix this problem 🙏🙏",2
It's just an opinion but I think you should have private individual and group private chats. And also the video constantly cuts off.,2
Easy and serves its purpose but even with excellent internet access and conbection in the duration of a highly important meeting that was of the highest of importance to my life and values my call was dropped 5 times and re accessing was easy yet inconvenirnt and easy fixable by correcting configuration of applicable use and the bandwidth settings to accept constantly variable frequncies allowing un interrupted and continous access without complications,1
Ok nice,1

First time use. Let us have some time,1
This app is awesome to meet friends and family online. But it would be much better if there is access to virtual backgrounds and have good video clarity(Brightness ect.) in android tabs and phones. This will not only be good for me but for all those people using zoom in android. The next problem is that sometimes it's shows incorrect password even if the password is correct. This had happened to most of my classmates and also causes a delay to the entire class. Please solve the problems.,1
Some bug still following,1

"I've used this app a total of 4 times since I installed it. Every time, I was in my meeting for approximately 20 mins and 3/4 times, it worked flawlessly. I had sound when I needed it, I was able to turn my camera and my microphone on and off when it was called for and it never gave me a problem. When I was in a meeting this morning however, after about 15-20 mins, the video started to get fuzzy and the sound cut out for a few seconds. The problem quickly resolved itself so it wasn't too bad",2

"I find this app to be very well designed (use of Android design guidelines and an action bar!). I also like the conference call management features and the contact interface, as well as the easiness of scheduling.  This is a fine example of what Android apps can and should be when they are written with design and UX patterns in mind. The service is awesome, too.",2

ios app vs android is not equal. Why can't you just type in a link and go on both? Why does the back button close the app? Why can't you easily leave a room and enter another? UI could be so much more intuitive,1

The last update has caused the phone to heat up/overheat more than normal. To the point that I can't use split screen for more than a few minutes. When I'm not using split screen it is still noticeable how hot the phone. It also is very heavy on battery consumption.,1

Worst app ever...need to uninstall and install again when I want to use it... Not recommended...,0
Difficult to sustain a/v connection. Some participants had intermittent audio while speaking (lots of dropout). Others were heard/seen well. I could not comment with a question at all. Will go to the Webex and Safepaths home page to attempt debug on my smartphone (Galaxy A50).,1
If only there's a timer to stop the meet and it gives a bell sound at the end because some teachers go beyond their time schedules,1

I was asked to update to v. 5.8.6, but could not force the system to do so, even after removing and re-installing the app. Now the important meeting is over and I haven't figured out how to fix the problem, yet.",1
It is quite good. Buy sometimes lagging,0
"One of the major issue with the app is that the chat session of the app keeps scrolling itself back and forth even when it already being scrolled manually, hence creating a loop where you are just stuck at a fixed location and can not scroll any further.",1

Upset with the app I uninstalled. Cant see one feature which excited me. To take a class through video calling is very annoying because you cant control the video calls voice you cant mute or unmute.

"It works well. I would like to be able to make the shared screen, full screen and remove the box of who is speaking.",2
The audio was distorted,1
Echoing issues freezing issues buffering issues. Usually because there's a certain amount of people in the meeting. Like as if it can't support that many people without flaws. But overall does the trick more or less if your not to much of a perfectionist.,1
"The app Sometimes doesnt even work ffs, it doesnt let me log in or join meetings the app just randomly stops working, if my school district wasnt so stupid and just used google meet, i wouldnt need this piece of garbage.",0
"At first it was good with occasional stutters. But yesterday i had a phone update (current using Xiaomi device) and now every 10 minutes it cuts me off the internet connection and i have to restart the app, during that time i lose time instead of being in the online class im now constantly restarting the damn thing. I wish i could give it lower than 1 star its so bad. If we didn't have to make online schooling i would instantly delete this aweful app from my phone and never download it again",0

This app is one of the best apps I've ever used but sadly the app takes storage whcih is not good for students like me who have lower storage like 8GB or 16GB.

"Extremely confusing. I have a chromebook for school and we were assigned to use teams to get in touch with our teachers and classmates. Everyone could see each other's faces but me. My teacher said that they were all in gallery mode, but I had it to where the person speaking was up on the screen. I checked the three-dots where my teacher told me to look, but all I saw was keypad, enter full screen, stop incoming video, etc. I need to know how to go on gallery mode on a chromebook for school.",0
simple and reliable. switched from webex and i would never look back.,2

My camera was totally distorted while I was waiting to get in the meeting the camera was nice and clear but once I joined the meeting my whole screen went. Also I only saw the option for group chat I could not text someone privately during the meeting so I had to send emails throughout the meeting,0
Works consistently and over multiple platforms. No need for participants to buy anything.,2

"Thanks 👍😊 Google for making to this type of awesome app . It is so easy to use .But I have an issue with it ,when I attend my school classes in full screen mode ,there is a box(icon) of our ID on the top right corner .Because of that I miss some words on the board .So please fix this issue as soon as possible.",2
"I have rated this app as a 5 star one for a long time but not anymore since the last update , it's hard to know which file from which group since they are all mixed in one place , also some files went missing literally 2 minutes after the update . That's what i found out only after 5 minutes from updating the app",0
I do this app bit different in go to webinar,2
Sound started breaking when I turned on my video. I was using my phone for the meeting.,2
"Works, but bluetooth stops every couple minutes, as in bluetooth is still connected to the phone, but suddenly there's no sound coming out, I had to work around it by switching to phone then back to bluetooth and miss some conversations. Also, dial in audio quality sucks big time no matter how good your mic is.",1
Video quality might be better.,2
"The worst app came across, closing every now and then, audio connection is extremely poor.",0
You should have filters for students' face so that they can study online properly.,1
It cuts out at times.,1
"Quality is okay, and has gotten better during the pandemic, but I use this program to teach and a consistent 25% of our adult students are unable to log in with sound and video working. If we were allowed to use a different platform we would, it is headache for our participants and us, we spend hours trying to fix issues that don't exist on other platforms.",0
Zoom is pretty good. The only thing i don't like is that its not unlimited zoom meetings.,2
This app is amazing... The only thing i dont like in this app is we cannot change background in a mobile phone when we are in a meeting wgile in a laptop or a desktop we cab change it. So pls give qn option for changing background un a mobile phone also...,1
It's a good app but I want only one thing in mobile that is that we can change background,1
Great,2
"Not only does the app have limited working UI, they restrict your notifications and take a dump on your head saying it's all your fault. They say you need to spend YOUR money for a computer JUST to turn off email notifications? I dont want a separate freakin email every time someone has sent something. Put the email notifications option on the mobile version or don't have a mobile version at all. Waste of money and time.",0

I don't like but i like hahaha,2
This is the best meeting app I have ever used. This is the easiest way to held your meeting. The best things are we can present screen apply visual affects change layout .

This App doesn't let u connect voice through phone or regular call ... I wish it has webex/zoom functionality to connect from phone. Webex was pretty cool about that once u enroll your cell number its automatically calls u once u join meeting for audio...,1
"Way too many updates! That means a poor IT department! I haven't updated it in over a year and it's still working. Once the world starts getting a little bit more back to normal, after the scamdemic hysteria runs its course, you guys will probably shut down! 😂🤣 Too bad, huh? #FJB",0
Conversations don't update real time at all. Especially when the app is also open on a computer. I get notified 30 minutes after receiving a message or only when I refresh manually... We expect so much more from Microsoft.,0
Connection not the best!,1
"Very choppy video and audio, freezes occasionally, and no option to use wifi only! Plowed through nearly 2gb of data before I realized I was disconnected from wifi. Pretty disappointed with this app.",0
Ok,2
This app is very nice but the Audio is nonconnectable sometimes because of server problem,1
Buggy.. renders a black screen when I'm select a notification. Can't read what I'm writing in the chat / message..,0
"Others frequently can't hear my on my Dell, even though i see microphone meters",0

"I really love the idea of this service! It is by far the easiest/highest quality service out there. The only thing that would make it better would be the ability to compleetly full-screen the video of the other person so that nothing covers any part of it. This would be esspecially useful if the other person is sharing their computer's screen. Currently part of their screen is covered/cut off. It would be great to see just their screen and nothing else. Otherwise, great app & superb service. Keep it up!",2

Works OK but I cannot disentangle it from my (now closed) NHS Mail account. I have set up a new account (or thought I had) but it still takes me to an NHS login page which I no longer have credentials for.

Teams and Outlook mobile apps just seems like a B Grade company products. Not user friendly but employer friendly since they provide some sneaky features to monitoring employees.

There is a problem to receive calls in my xiaomi redmi note 9 pro,1
"Awful, barely usable.",0
Screen sharing ability is poor. If you share one screen and it's not full size then the participants see a small screen in the middle of their viewer rather than the shared content occupying their viewer. This greatly affects the ability to share a document and take meeting notes at the same time. Zoom is better in this regard. Also webex doesn't consistently display all meetings across devices causing me to miss meetings.,1
The best,2
"A great app and platform, stable and easy-to-use, to connect with others 👏.",2
I've uninstall the app then install it again because it was logging off on its own hope it doesnt log off again and hope the issue be solved.,2

Terrible app. Can never get it to work. I am trying to call someone who has the app installed and open but we are unable to send/receive messages or make a call.

"For some mind boggling reason, they force you to log in every. time. you open the app. I don't understand how they think this makes the app usable.",0
Super working,2
I am sure my microphone is on But others could not hear me All time say duration of call is large,0
"Oct 2021: It seems Teams can do everything Zoom can and more (e.g. the mid-call transfer between devices is outstanding / seamless). Feb 2021: I'm liking Teams. There may be things that slack and zoom do better individually in their respective core competencies, but as far as a collaboration + realtime video meeting all-in-one solution it's hard to beat this.",2
the app is not responding properly,0
"I love this app,I gave two star because in my meet the effect option is not availabe. mine is updated version of google.And in the google meet the camera is dimmed I don't know what is the problem with that but it only occurs in google meet . Please fix my problem",0
Good app but has some audio issues,1
App won't allow sign in using LinkedIn,0
"What a pain! The in-meeting controls are not intuitive, and HARD TO FIND!",0
"This is a really great tool to create a community for your job. It's pretty much the same as Facebook so you can follow specific people and join specialised groups based on your interests (my work has a book group, pet group, etc). They also pass on important information like if they're running a promotion or anything else they need to communicate.",2
"Zoom has been an invaluable tool during covid, and is allowing me to stay close with friends across the country - thank you!!",2
This app is very useful for any type of netting and teaching aslo in this app there is sheet which is use ful for the understanding of matter,2
Works perfectly.. With phone and computer.. You just need to download.. You can visit other app whilst staying online with and it is free if you are not the host.. Or a business.. Good for students/and private classes..,2
"Man, that's very big in size if considered from the business app point of 
view. Do something to reduce the size.",1
Like several others I don't receive notifications until I open the app on my phone. This means I am missing important messages. It is really important that this glitch is fixed asap. When are you going to fix the issue of not receiving notifications?,0
My head phone does not connect during using this app,2
Echo disrupting communication....,1
Would give more but one thing of disturbing: When the app runs in the background on my smartphone (24h/day) my status remains available. Didn't find out how to deactivate that. So people think I'm online when I'm sleeping.,1
"OK if you get connected, but I already registered a room name online, and now can't use the app to get there, have to use browser. pointless.",0
Still bad. Great concept but god awful UI. The interface is insanely confusing and bloated. The app preforms like a potato on even the latest of phones. Both of these issues are present in the windows version too so it's not just the Android app. Microsoft historically has some of the worst UIs ever made. Unfortunately I am required to use this mediocre app for work but if I had a choice is never consider it. It's amazing that a company known for software continuously makes terrible software.,0
"The illustrations are clear , but alot of audio issues.",1
"Fewer dropped connections with stronger internet signal strength. I have had a great experience with Zoom & very helpful customer service . Easy to learn. Lots of fixes from previous versions that makes this a great tool for business as well as personal use. The free version is acceptable and the paid pro version is better if you need longer time and a larger audience. Lots of features in settings, backgrounds & filters w/o green screen. Computer must be compatible/newer to enable some features",2
Although I haven't worked out all the kinks. I do believe they are mostly at my fault for lack of knowledge. Video is perfectly clear. Audio is very understandable. You should enjoy this site..,2
Good workplace thumb max,2
"Is great integration between chat, video, and enterprise file storage.",2
Awesome free conference call option. Easy to use and easy to navigate for users. Shared screen options make conferencing that much better!,2
It is a very nice app for online classes but I give it only 4 stars because it doesn't have the option to use background during video in smartphones,2
"Absolutely terrible connection, people talking over each other because of it and overall poorly executed",0
consumes more data than other,0
Moulamoulam,2
Good,2
Excellent,2
"I have been using this app for nearly 2 years, and it has been very useful to me. I like the new update very much.",2
nice,1
All collegues have disappeared from all our groups and it will not let me re add them..pointless,0
This app takes very much internet... And there are very many options which I really don't like... U people are taking feedback from us.... But I want to know that u people are working on it or not... Please try to work on it ..... Thanks,1
Convenient. Easy to use.,2
satisfied with quality of audio & reception,2
"Audio is good, Video - can't find the setting when light flickering (very irritating).",2
My background screen was not working properly please do something and fix my problem,1
Good,2
Very good,0
Can be better,1
"So First problem is that we study in it😂🤭 Nope it's not a Problem... But the problem is you guys should remove the calender thing at the top it's too irritating when we have to refresh, we don't get the meeting until somebody send the link or we open and close teams again and again. And if we have to refresh it I don't know why we have to slide up and then it's finally in June!! How will it be in June if it's August!!?? Calla and meetings works good! But Pls fix this problem. Thank You😇",1
This program spy on you because when you are talking he told you open mikrofon so I didn't live this program don't install it,0
Happy feling,1
Good app but the meeting is finishing in 40 minutes plz reslove that,1
Previously had connection issues which seems to have improved. also have an issue where my bluetooth volume keeps lowering itself woth no interaction from me. downloaded a log viewer to find webex lowering the volume on me even when the app has been closed for days. only fix is to uninstall yhr app when not in use. previously on Android 8.x now 9.x LG v40 issue still persists.,1
I hope the android phone users can change background and record as well. I'm using GalaxyA7,2
Ok,2

"Not good, audio was horrible Complicated to sign in",1
This app is not very good but my problem was that I am not able to sing in it always show you are not eligible at this time please slove that problem,0
"Really enjoyed the auto dial in feature, I wish I could have captured a wider angle on the video and I enjoyed how we can easily mut or stop video sharing during the meeting with ease.",2
I have enjoyed using gotomeetings it's easy to navigate and very user friendly.,2
very well explained. Thanx .,2
I have a confusions I don't click the Microphone is off but sometimes it on please set this Glitch on my control and also all single person.,0
"Good, but need to be able to multifunction, such as chat while watching presentations.",2
In Google meet I can't get the pop up option only while seeing participants pop up comes please fix quickly as possible,1
Nice app i love it,1
"After the recent update I'm unable to open the assignments worksheets in Mobile (Device) And it's not only happening with me, my friends are also facing the same... Please fix it, because exams are going on this month..",1
"Security overkill. Logged in from the same phone as Authenticator. Security time out while screen is locked. The Security steps to send a message 1) unlock phone 2) open teams, enter password 3) open authenticator, unlock phone 4) approve sign in/copy enter code 5) stay signed in? 6) more info needed press next (Fails if on mobile data) 7) verify info, press next At least 7 steps on the same device that runs authenticator. 1,2 and 7 should be enough (5 on first log in). 6 is from Vista",1
"Not good. Great difficulty getting on for our event. Then, nothing. Left the meeting and attempted to get on again and it said you're already on. Contact the host. It's a performance. And I can't see it.",0
Great service.,2
Very good application,2
"They said there's new update, which that's the background at phone and when i updated it I can't see the background thing, i restart my meet and actually nothing happened",1
The absolute best app for conferencing I have come across to date!  I been doing this for a decade folks and this app easily gets it right,2
abit slow here and there but otherwise ok,1
THE WORST app for meetings and webinars. I had 3 classes on the app where each of the class had to be ended midway due to persistent screen lag and voice cracking.,0
If i download it is not downloading,1
The audio is breaks down very much,1
A nice app but needs some more applications,1
Very bad app experience in app built notifications are worst not recommendable,0
Good,1
consumes more data than other,0
That beep which takes place wherever a participant joins is irritating,1
Need to use this for my job's interview and its a good app.. sometimes it has audio concerns but i guess its on my internet connection..,2
Excellent,2
I love,2
"Teams is a great app for online classes, although in meetings in channels we should be able to see the latest texts at the bottom every time a text pops, but the app always takes you towards the very top, which is pretty annoying and you have scroll endlessly to get to new messages. Please fix this issues.",1

Poor,0
Good,2
It is typical..,2
It's a nice app. It helps me to connect to people I might not be able to meet physically. But it drains my phone's battery so quickly,1
Used to work okay but now requires additional apps to function. I just use it in the browser now. Still can't compete with slack for chat or bluejeans for meetings.,0
"Never used this app before and gotta say, considering I had really good cell service while using, it was very clear audio and video. Noice!!!",2
"Ita really a nice app for meetings and nowadays it is really a nice app for classes. But nowadays whenever I join with Id it's asking for registration!!! That's awful😖😖, after completinb my registration also I can't attend meetings, please look into it!!",1

After last update there is no way to change audio output to play thru speakerphone. Thumbs down 👎,0
Good app in this tough period but video quality is not good,0
not good,1
Good sound quality. Okay video quality. Relatively easy to use. Improved maneuverability options would be beneficial.,1
It was phenomenal. I jumped on the app on my phone as I was having difficulties logging in on my computer to conduct a WebEx interview. Using the WebEx app on my phone was so seamless and saved me from canceling an appointment. Also turned out to be a great interview too🙂,2
love this app,2
"I had no audio, I had to watch the presentation on my tablet and call in on my cell to get audio.",1
This app is nice tho but its not letting me to make a meeting i dont know why please fix it thank you,1
I can't add a pin to my conference from the Android app.,1
The previous version was much better & easier than this new version to operate and use chat box...,0
"The app was greet, the only downside on my experience is that my audience can't hear the audio of the video i presented",1
The Interface is Simple& Easy to Use... But It Has So Many Bugs to Fix... Fix the Bugs... Don't Make the Bugs as a Feature...,0
For school,1
Good app,2
Great but also needs ability to allow entry into meeting straight away without waiting to be admitted by host,2
boring,1
Awesome sauce,2
Very good awesome service,2
Always looking fowrad to join because the sermons are spot on very useful and fruitful.,0
"Very simple to figure out, and there was no lagging in the video feed or voice control.",2
Good,0
"The app is a let down it's just the same thing you see on the computer.  I was looking for notifications nope not there, then I was looking to turn down the resolution to so my phone wasn't working so hard.  App freezes all the time and is not reliable.  Was hoping for a lot more the creators went super cheap on this and it shows!",0
"Great app. But recently it's not playing videos, they are all black? Can still hear sound thou. Please fix!! Need it for work purposes so very important!!",1

Hi hello. theres something really annoying about the update.. When i enter full screenmode.. i cant see the top right corner because my profile is blocking it. i cant remove it anymore like on the early versions.. this really slows down my reading and kinda embarassing.,1
Keep on showing joining...not useful for business meetings...it will waste your time by trying to connect and connect again...,0
Its good .....but it would be great if we can control auto rotating of the screen.,1
Stinking pile of garbage as a product. Made me feel like I was using Yahoo Messenger video call in 2008.,0
Troubles refreshing. hoping update will help,2
"After a trip to Germany, the app kept using the German number. Cost me $60 in international calls. Unable to fix this without changing to ""call me"" for all meetings. Frequent authentication means you can't reliably call in quickly from your mobile device.",1
screen sharing issues,1
I would rate it 3 stars bc it keeps on hanging and keeps on telling me meeting is full! Tells me that speakers and microphone not working It is annoying webex pls fix this ASAP ! but good I guess.,1
"I had a good experience using this app but recently it's keep logging out which is bit annoying,every second day i have to log into the app",1
Thanks,1
Once I turned the speaker feature on it would not turn off. Really poor design for a shipped product.,0
I didn't find the background changing option I updated the Google meet but I cannot change my background,1
"I had this at 5 stars but downgraded it. A super annoying problem is that the keyboard covers the text window you are typing in, in the chat. Samsung S21.",1
"Conflicts with other comms apps, but generally works. Update: Teams continues to make improvements and gets better every month. There's not a better tool available. I'm keeping the 4 star rating, because there is still work to do.",2
I hate this applications,2
Amazing,2
Ok,2

"Very bad app I can't join my meetings 10 ,20 ,30 minutes late I am. I will assure not to use this app . Whrn I report problem that after that also it doesn't work . My friends are also worried I too very bad app for meeting . The server of this is always down. Its also shows connecting and then shows error code - 104114 . Everyday i faces faces problems in the meeting . I alwaus got disconnected. Don't use this app friends.thank you",0
"Hello, MS Teams all in all is an extremely useful app for business and studies. One thing that I found right now - the bluring background is bluring Christmas hats, no colours matters (blue or red) 😄 Besides that everything is fine, thank you!",2
My company uses this app for meetings and other remote sessions. It works well for most things. A simple meeting face to face or over the phone with many in the company this does very well. The problem is the inability to play a video with sound during a meeting. In many instances this has been needed but not possible with Go To Meeting.,0
Nice app but sometimes it laggs very much . We cannot hear others voice or sometimes others video become blur . Btw this app is good 😊,1
Kindly provide the feature of recording meeting for future use. Also store the meeting recording at cloud storage. It would help a lot of students. Thank you,1
my first months of using this app went well🙂 but just recently i felt quite annoyed and disappointed when i did joined meeting then suddenly i was out and i find hard time getting back... i even had to uninstall and reinstall the app twice now😔 it's just so sad because i have important meetings to attend through this app..i hope this could be fixed ASAP😊 I'd probably had my 5 stars when it's work well again..,1

Very useful one for the teachers and students.....,1
It is awesome but somewhat slow,1
Freezes,1
"Works as described, no glitches. Took a star away because this app is a processor hog. I always get a notification that the cpu is over working. If you add poor cell signal, the video is mostly unwatchable.",2
This is an nice video calling and cofferencing app. the app is user friendly interface. The way we join in meeting is very easy.just know the Id We can easily join in it. Updated version is so nice and smooth.,2

"Literally this app is better than any other group video calling app,(auto generated correct captions for widely used languages and quality of video audio is much better than other apps) you should try it atleast once!",2
"A very good app. However, one can't view text clearly",1
👍,1
I like it,1
"The app is good but could be better. Having to constantly restart your video feed is frustrating. It's like a 20 minute timer stops your feed. You don't leave the chat, you just aren't visible & you must ""start video"" over and over.",1
This app is very update I like it. There is also a delay when the shared screen of the host or someone else the screen comes very late that at least takes 10 to 25 seconds but in google meet the screen comes immediately. But in my video option the virtual background option is not there at all. Please help in fixing the virtual background.,1

Poor. No way to start my camera No way to preview camera. I had a job interview that went sour because my camera did not start!,1
Mute unmute is manually anyone mute the participants ensure that this problem not having any acess for this problem who is mute the participants.,1

Hmmm .. not baad,0
Use on the app life time,2
I want background while class please,1
Great venue for mobile meetings. I'm able to be a part of meetings while being a passenger in the car. Can't beat that technology.,2
Nice game,1
Teams calls don't always come through to the app. Other than that the app works good.,2
Easy to use. One thing I'll add here that while using this app i was not able to switch my cell back camera.,2
Audio distrubances.,1
Good reception and clarity of voices.,2
"my camera always mirrors on other people's cellphones, even though I have turned off the mirror camera feature, that's what makes me hate it",0

"Good overall, they heard and was able to see me, but audio may have been sketchy because of my location.",1
There's no option for us to dial into the conference via phone data call. We basically need to call a phone number which isn't toll free for where I'm from. Conference calls via the PC doesn't have this problem. Even Google hangouts enables this which is what I'm coming from.,0
A pretty convenient way to have Teams on the go. I wish it was better at knowing when you've checked a message on the desktop version so it didn't have to send you a notification on your phone too.,2
Great call quality thanks to webrtc and finally no more pins,2
Could not join from my PC. Had so much hassle.,0
Worst aap voice not hearing,0
App randomly dropped out on a meeting and wouldn't reconnect at all.,0
It's a nice app. And it's convenient to use also but I'm not getting any updates. My sister who also uses this got update and she updated.I always check if there is any updates but nothing came. Even though I tried uninstalled and reinstalled but still I'm getting the old version.,1

Many functions but too unstructured to find old posts and my video conferences hang in the middle of video conferences. Please make old posts easier to search and the video should not hang in an important meeting,2

Lot of background noise and echoes. Require good bandwidth.,1
"Worst conference app I have ever seen in my life. There are various issues I am facing. Like, some of the times my audio is not connecting where I am having a good network connection. Then, if I share the screen it is not visible to the other participants. Overall an app with various bugs. Also with this several times I am unable to join and wait in the lobby. In spite of having 50-60 kb/s network I am facing these issues.",0

There are several bugs and it is also very laggy. When l enter into a meeting it takes a long time to load things up. If I turn on my video it will only open after 2 to 3 mins. I don't know what this is.... 😠. I request you to fix this issue in the teams app for PC!",0
A very good software for students.,2
"Phone used to Review: OnePlus 6 Great mobile platform. Almost perfectly replicates the Desktop Teams app. Meetings are smooth, chats and channels look exactly like the desktop counterpart, and the walkie talkie feature is also great to use.",2
"Great app byt if you have a unsatbel connection you can never stay without the screen or voice getting stuck.To use this properly u need a very good connetion.Also when i got it on my laptop it makes the whole device slow and makes it very laggy, it dosent happen with any other app",1
"Whenever we get any urgent call and if we receives the call the meeting is ended ,Please Google resolve this problem . And also please provide and option to turn on the front camera LED flash during a meeting because when there is a power cut the users have to suffer a lot because of improper lightning . Every phone has LED front camera flash so it consumes least battery so I think Turning on the front camera flash light option during a meeting must be provided Thank You .",1

"I really love UberConference with it's nice interface and easy functionality. Unfortunately it's too limited. Boasts video and screen share capability but invites only mention dial-in option, video is laptop/computer accessible only and recording only captures the audio. For the money I pay as a business account member, Zoom offers a lot more and I have unfortunately outgrown this platform. I will miss UberConference!",1
"I had a conference meeting with a company today (10th Oct 2019) and I am amazed at how well it went using this app. It's a fantastic experience to be able to have a meeting with people in different locations in the country, especially if you can't be in the same location for a physical meeting for whatever reason. This app is awesome, I highly recommend it!",2
Unfortunately UC doesn't offer local dial in numbers for two of the largest emerging markets. Works great in OZ!,0

Amazing bulk video and audio calling facility with good Quality. Uninterruptable Streaming. Simply superb.,2
I only use it because I have to for work. Does the job but is lacking in practical features. You can't group conversation together per theme so you end up with 50 active conversations. You can't pin groups ... Only singular chats. I wish this was like discord. You can't search in a conversation per date. You can't tell the difference between conversations and meetings in the chat history. You can't see people's schedules when trying to book a meeting on the app like you can on desktop.,0

"I was very excited about this service when I found it. It was exactly what I needed and the promotional video nailed it! I installed and tested out some the features. Wow, pretty cool.  Unfortunately, when I finally used it on an actual conference call with a client, the service (I was using it from the browser) crapped out on me several times. What an embarrassment! I do not know exactly what caused the issue but I couldn't hear the client but the client could hear me (some muting issue) and so I had to call back in. After the second time, I stop using Uber and just called the client directly since there was only two parties on the call this time.  Now, I have to reconsider my options until this is resolved and I have the confidence again in the service. Bummer.",0
Inaudible audio,1

Easy to use conference calling features. Great for small team calls. More callers and features require a monthly subscription which is a much cheaper than Gotomeeting.,2
"Rough, to say the least. Still, my cell was ultimately able to connect to the webinar at about the half way point. I could not establish this with my pc to matter what I tried. The cell/Android app got me in, but the interface could be far more intuitive/user friendly. Some nice features, but one-click access to them would definitely be helpful, especially when one has to switch from the video stream to the concurrently running chat feature (and back again) to fully experience the webinar.",1
Zoom is the worst app ever (u should never use it) zoom id the worst app cause it takes money now in since of internet it takes money I mean zoom takes internet for meetings and internet cost money and making zoom work offline without internet will help people a lot they wont have to purchase internet just for classes or for business so u revive 1 star,0
This app is very good but Please Co-host options available for personal/normal accounts also. Because there are many teachers teaching or managing the classes,0

Good sound low lag. This app is great for small meetings. I have not tried with meeting greater than 40-50 people yet. But it should be sufficient for 99% of the meetings we have.

"Excellent. Used it intensively during lockdown as a university teacher, was very helpful. I would recommend to find some clever way to have something like an internal agenda of zoom meetings. In practice, one receives many messages with an awful zoom link. I don't want to rely on a cloud agenda and thus still have my small pocket paper agenda. Syncing this with the many zoom links is not possible. Storing the invitations in my zoom account, within an agenda or something else, would solve it.",2

Initial experience with this app for a website interview for a position with a company who began utilizing GoToMeeting within the past month. I found connecting with my Samsung S10+ (512mb memory) fairly easy. The Android based software was easy to navigate with the design of the programming.

Very slow,0
"if you need it, you need it. If you don't specifically need it, you probably aren't reading reviews about it, you're using Zoom.",2
The app has improved a lot during recent updates. It is a lot more stable. There have also been usability improvements. I would say that it is very user-friendly and stable.,2
Nice,0
Super Fantastic speakers through worksource! They are so fun to work with and very very helpful! Thank-you,2
Good,2
Switching between WiFi and mobile data mode is a pain. This app routinely ends up hogging on my mobile data when its default behavior ought be to turn off video stream and just keep audio stream alive.,1
Since last few days the app is automatically stops working and kicks out of meeting.,0
Apart from few network problems the service is excellent.,2
Creat link,0
Android auto integration sucks! I don't get any controls to mute or unmute like what I get on MS teams,1
Ok,1

It's a request please add video mirroring option in phone. The video appears mirrored to me but for other meet members it doesn't look applealing. It's a humble request please add video mirroring option.,0
Very cutting of voice when anyone admit's in the voice will cut for 2-5 seconds,1
Whereby Rate this App,2
It is a good app but there is a problem that before the joining classes we might reinstall our app. We can't join classes if we don't reinstall app. Please try to understand our problems.,1
Wonderful,2
Ok,1
At times in class the teacher can't hear me and I can't hear either the teacher or the students also it has a limited amount of time for you to do you class etc.... So every 15-30 minutes you have to rejoin the class....,1
Useless. Does not allow single sign on from mobile device. Pointless to have on my phone as the only time I use this bloated software is for university work,0
Very clear sound,2
It's good but nowadays it's problems are increasing....It takes a lot time to join a meeting though my network is alright...plsss improve it as soon as possible,1
Looks like they fixed the auto exposure issue. Seems to work well now. Thanks!,2

I am using this app for online classes. We are continuously getting audio issues. This irritate me while using this.,0
"I find ease of use to be pretty good. The quality for me is not consistent, video and audio is sketchy at times which is the reason my rating is only 2 stars.",0
What a great software for free. I had no problems installing it or using it. Very easy to use. Fuse to calling you have to write down the numbers but that works fine. Going to the video you just click the simple link it takes you right in. Very grateful for GoToMeeting so I can connect 2 groups touring when we can't meet face to face. Just did yoga today and it was perfect. I've done a couple other groups and it's nice to connect and do things together as a group,2
"Some point are irritating in this app, like when mute it's sounds, when u mute it's sounds,",1
Works as advertised on paid tier,2
I love this App. If it weren't for Zoom I would have never sobered up and saved my life through this pandemic. I am forever grateful for Zoom!!!!,2
"What the heck is this when am try ti see when some one is live its saying can't play video,after the live feed ends it's fine,plays well..",0
While doing class after 10 mins the screen is getting blank and disconnected....again I have to connect from the beginning.. Why this is happening please see the matter.,0
Veru good,2
Improve its timing it stops after 1 hour,2
Workplace app is very beautiful,2
This platform provides more communication options and is much more safe and stable.,2
"I have been enjoying this app infact I loved it so much that I could have given 5stars.not until recently after some updates, my phone is now always tripping off every 15-20 minutes into a meeting. Even when I log in again it happens again and again. Particularly when am u muted and speaking. This doesn't happen with other apps on my phone. Please kindly tell me what could be the cause, or check if there are bugs with the recent updates. Until that is fixed I could only give 1 star.",0
IT IS NOT GIVEN AS FREE PLS GIVE FREE,0
Nice aap,2
"Waaaaay to much traffic, ideal place for scammers.",0
It is not a good app because I can't sign in the email and the password was correct but it is not signing in,0
Works alright. Keyboard covers most of what is being written which is a pain.,1
During the pandemic suitattion it was very helpful for education field,2
It had become a necessity at work. Video chat is excellent. So much better than Skype.,2
Oke,1
Zoom is excellent for meetings. People who are invited can join from any country.,2
"Please fix. Since last update, app won't start on my note 4. Will update rating once fixed.",0

Really great works smoothly only things is that I wish I could zoom further in but besides that's its really good,2
"Love this app. Our team has been using it for 2 years now. Flawless, lightweight, no ads, never crashes.",2

It is still showing your device(lenovoo tab M10) might not be optimised by zoom,0

When I join meeting no voice is coming to me and my voice didn't going there and not showing the present screen but have to go back then I have to join for 10+ times then it's solved and when I join meeting firstly then it's not joining so ill rate it 2 starts only Thanks bye .,0
"Great.. with video without a glitch all thru the call, even on phone with only 3 signal bars",2
This app glitches when live videos are playing or when recording live videos all the time. It is pretty cool otherwise.,1
Straightforward and really more than one can ask for.,2
ITS NICE APP BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN EVER I TRY TO UNMUTE AND SPEAK NONE CAN HEAR ME AND WHEN I TRY IT ON OTHER APP EVERYONE CAN HEAR ME CAN YOU PLEASE FIX ME MIKE PROBLEM ? BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN MARK ABSENT DUE TO THIS 😶..,1
Okk,1
Nice not really,1
"Everytime to login if an application asking for a password, that is not user-friendly and people who are using would start to think twice to have it on their phone. Better MS team start looking into this.",0
Frustrated trying to use from a computer in my car but had many problems with viewing. I switched to my phone but the audio doesn't work unless the car is turned off. Many of the icons aren't available on my phone,0
Super easy to join and incredibly helpful to actually be able to see who's on the call and speaking.,2

"Unable to dial in, unable to use mobile audio, audio in desktop app very poor quality. Back to Zoom.",0
This app is extremely good app it is so much helpful for my online class.But it have one problem that in new version we cannot permanantly change our name and if we change afterwords we cannot change.,2
It's a nice app for teachers students and even if we want a meeting we can do it from zoom meeting I gave it 4 stars because when I join a meeting sometimes it shows that you have join from other device so that's why,2
"Too much static, too much background noise even when people are muted and the only person talking is the host.",1

"Excellent session ji. We need more such discources to enlighten, not only Sikhs but also, others on the authentic uniqueness of Guru Nanak's Spirituality. I am ever grateful to Dr Karminder Singh Dhillon for the little knowledge I have gained on Sikhi by attending his classes from the time he commenced conducting in a local Gurdwara in Malaysia. And now I have been listening to his videos on Sikhi Concepts, Hijacking of Sikhi and the latest on the Hijacking of Guru Nanak's Birthday .",2

microphone are not working...so I had to use chat on the meeting,0
Good app,2
It was good except the volume which was fluctuating,2
This is a good app but lag,1
Has trouble internationally communicating. Interface takes awhile to get used to. But useful overall if you can make it work.,1
Nice app,1
The interface for turning on and off for video and mic should be made user friendly,1
"Poorly optimized, camera freezes a lot, sometimes it doesn't turn on at all, quite laggy at times. Unfortunately, zoom is better for group conversation with video",0
Very high quality,2
Great advice. We appreciate learning new information regarding passenger limits and how to handle the situation if it arises.,2
"The app is hardly usable. The android keyboard overlays the text area field, so I never can see what I'm printing right now. That's amazing how is it possible: messaging app without possibility to see the text while printing. Right now using it like a pager. Please, resolve keyboard issue. Other updates looks pretty funny, cause your main feature doesn't work well.",0
Excellent,1
Gotomeeting is by far one of the best apps used for meetings that i have came across yet. It really makes me feel like if im attending the meeting in person. By far way better than ZOOM APP. i love the gotomeeting app,2

When you actually get through to someone its ok. Otherr than that its an awful app. Cant schedule appointments cant add people or favorite and wont let me start a chat. DO NOT waste your time.,0

Its a weird app,1
"I have found all awsome , but i can't found that we can't change background and one more thing it's taking more and more network.",2
There is no option to blur the background. Give that option to the blur the background,1
Worst app ever,1
Super,2
It is good but the background didn't work in my phone. Why it is brand new and has new model . Why. Why. Why.,1
Voice clarity missing,1
unless you are using a personal computer and not a mobile device to mobile experience with this application was extremely horrible due to the fact that you would have to use headphones in order for proper and clear communication. For being a video and audio application this application needs a lot of work in order to get a better rating.,0
good,2
horrible audio. had to give up and use a cell connection.,0

"Works surprisingly well. Has good control over where the sound is output, so it works well with Bluetooth in the car *and* allows you to seamlessly transition when you get to the office! When someone shares their screen, you can pinch to zoom, which is a great feature. The developers have just done a great job all around on this app.",2

Unbelievable .,2
Very usefull especially when need to meet far aquitance in different country,2

"My reason for giving 2 stars is that I have some complaints about the app. There's no option of raising the hand. I can't find out how to change the theme of the app. The helps were of no use. All of a sudden after a few minutes, a saying 'Trying to speak? Switch on the microphone', is appearing Trying to make it more user friendly but is actually creating problems for me. I have a kind request to you to look into the matter. Once if the things are done, I promise to edit this review.",0
For the most part it works really good. The only real complaint I have is that you used to be able to select the program to share on the screen but now you can only select a display.,2
"Having a great experience using Zoom and the features are so easy to use. I will recommend for anyone wanting to organize meetings, seminars or programmes. I use it to conduct church services each week and it is very effective.",2
"Mobile needs some love.Teams is great, but feels like teams mobile is an after thought. Which is a real shame as it could be such a powerfull part of what Teams can do.",2
"It's okay. It used to have really good in-app over-the-Internet audio support. Now, it requires an outside third-party app, which is kinda janky and certainly less user-friendly and requires more steps. So that kinda sucks. But otherwise, it's fine.",1
Awesome app,2
"Use less app, not working in andirod mobiles",0
App doesn't stay running in background on OnePlus 8 (Android 11). No messages received when app in background.,0

Automatically left ...no sound and no video....,0
Worst app ever...many times call failed..sound interepted.,0
My experience with this app has been exceptional. Meeting people i havn't seen for years also shearing shearing ideas and learning from this tool has brought my attention to families and friends from all over the world. I said to myself this is a great tool for meetings of the mind. I will continue to use this tool of technology to build an empire between my family and friends.,2
"So, If there is a option to sent messages to the people in a meeting privately (which cant even see by the host )with a command like /msg or /message name it will be usefull and it improve your app a lot Hope that you guys will add this option on your next update",1

Great App for video meetings.,2
Very good app,2
This is good for online class. But it has only one problem it doesn't have virtual background that is only problem in this app otherwise it's very good app for online classes.,1
Not a good connection,1
"How do I get to download this on an AMAZON iPad because it isn't coming on the Amazon Appstore, I have it on Google Playstore but it just wouldnt work. I have it installed but it wouldnt show on the home screen and when I click on a Google Meet link it brings me right back to here. Is Google Meet accessible on Amazon iPads or devices or it isnt? If not I think it would be a great Idea to make it accessible on this device.",0
Excellent tool for teaching. Simple and effective. Highly recommend this for efficient teaching.,2

Check your internet connection and try again later This is showing everytime whenever I try joining any meeting I wanted to give 000000 stars but there's no option,0
Great app great idea,2

Very user friendly. I truly enjoyed the on-screen zoom feature to see presentation better from my phone.,2

I tried to attend a meeting and it would say the meeting has expired even though the meeting is in the future. I was able to connect via my PC without a problem using the go to meeting app. It just does not work for the android app.,0
Waste app. Calendar is not even loading. Zoom is better than this. The assignment file is not even loading. I recommend not to install this. Teams is degrading instead of updating.,0
There is not a raise hand button the past few times especially on the phone and sometimes if I raise my hand they don't see that it is raised. I just always have challenges with it.,0
Absolutely abysmal for Android. You can't even join an existing room from a link. Needs serious work.,0
very good,1
Is apk is very useful,2
How can I sign in sir??,1
Utter failurenin voice. No assistance from admin. Only Mookie. Meeting a failure. Zoom and google ate far better. Highest MB download. Still useless.,0
It not contain background for phone please work on background,0
Ekdum bakwas,0
Good,1
Why can't I see the file that others send into the chat in the meeting? It only happens on the mobile application but PC is work properly. Please answer my question since I didn't find the answer on the internet.,0
can barely connect. wish everyone used zoom.,0
I would like to request for the dark mode but this app is great,1
Every time asks for login,0
"The connection is alright, bit hope for the support features like virtual background and filters towards 'middle' specs android phone.",1
Great app. Easy to use,2
"Please fix like old version i dont like this because it has many problems camara only black, lagging every time i download old version but it update automatically 😭i will unistall it i hate this app😡😡😡",0
Used this app on my phone to connect to work meetings if and when I'm away from my desk. It's really well and has the same functionalities as the desktop version (albeit smaller). Clear display and audio. Highly recommended.,2
"The app was working fine to begin with, but now it has completely stopped giving me notifications. Even uninstalling it and reinstalling didn't work! If its run by Facebook, why doesn't it work like Facebook!?",0
It's not work,1
I want you to allow backgrounds on phone.....please....,1
Hi!..my phone is VIVO 1816 in my google meet background option is not coming...So please tell me how to change background...Thank you....,1
Very good for small group.,2
"Very simple, but that may be what I like best about this app, as it does not encumber the user with useless ""features"" or other extras. Allows meetings with pretty good quality (even over cellular connection), and quick and easy to use.",2
It was good overall.,1
Still needs refining,2
This aap so amazing facts about the prodion you have any questions,2
Not able to share audio with video while sharing screen in one plus phone inspite of doing all the settings.,0
Webex not an intuitive experience. The speakers video is overlayed on the presentation blotting out key points. Couldn't find a way to move it.,1
Good,2
Worst experience tough we are at good network area it hangs in between meetings whenever i used it i have faced this problem so please solve this problem,0
Banty,1
"Forced to use this by conference organizer. Okay app, I guess.",1
W😎,0
F@RAZ,1
This app was good. But nowadays I am not able to enter the meetings. It is always showing connecting and after a few minutes it will show error. Please fix this issue. I am a student and I am not able to attend my classes because of this.,1
Useful to all,1
"Assignment attachemnt download not working Update: in last update it seems that the feature has started working again, will check and update the review after a few days.",1
"I am pretty new to this app I but I have got to say so far it is my favorite App for meetings by call or video you can do both you can be on the phone and not have your video you can be on video oh it was so easy! to join is so easy, so easy to use! Call Ann video clarity art amazing. Controlling the meeting if you're the host the host is easy. Yup I absolutely love it",2
"Disappointing. Clicking on call URL doesn't give option of opening with app if already installed. When I open the app from app drawer, it insists on login or signup first, not allowing me to input URL directly either. Useless as I can't demand friends sign up for accounts simply to join a call. Uberconference works OK on computer Chrome or app (though clicking on link there also doesn't suggest or open desktop app) but the Android app is useless. Back to Zoom?",0
"Very good app but my vurtual background, Share audio and Filters options is not coming. Please give me this options🙏🙏",2
Ang bagal,0

Good quality,1
My mic keeps cutting when I am come out the app,1
I like this app but sometimes my meet will exits itself and when I rejoin then again my meeting is exit. Which was very irritating. My internet speed was also very good. So google please fix this issue.,0
It was good app. I had the chance to use it for my students before and after the pandemic. It has all the apps that is nessessary for educators to communicate with thier students online courses and face to face.,2
"Great on my computer. Unfortunately, doesnt work at all on my Samsung Galaxy S5. Very frustrating especially when coordinating conference calls.   UPDATE 9/15/15: I've since stopped using lifesize on my computer bc it makes my computer crash every time, and it leaves my computer glitchy for weeks after. I only use lifesize on my android tablet. The only place where it works fine, so far...",0
"It is a good app but consumes a lot of data, like A LOT. If this is fixed, everything's alright with this app.",1
"The app used to work fine. Now I can't get past a ""can't find a secure connection"" error, even when I'm connected to my home wifi. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, updating my phone software, etc etc and no dice. What gives?",0
Good work app,2
Voice may be improved in this app.,1
Voice breaking,1
"It was the gpod , the app is user friendly, but do add the feature of sending pics in the chat so that wr can send documents if needed",2
Experience is GOOD. But it CONSUMES SO MUCH INTERNET DATA.,1
Had a great meeting everything went better than expected.,2
Not very good video contact and very bad call,1

"I love this app for desktop version. But, the zoom on phone doesn't have any feature for changing aspect ratio (not only for my view but also for the entire meeting), camera resolution, and basically my camera isn't showing its fully potential related to autofocus, pixelrate, whitebalance, auto exposure, or many other features. Thanks for listening to my critique.",0
Good,2
"Dear zoom, I am getting automatically unmuted in my class and this is happening for other people too. Fix this bug because we can't talk with our family about something and it is unmuting people few times per meeting",0
Pankaj siddhey is correct it same happens to me also and whenever I join my class it shows just the host has not started meeting it never shows my classes,0
no sounds. can't hear,0
"Works fine on my phone, but to use it on my tablet is absolutely useless. Constantly tells me that launch URL is invalid but the link works just fine for my phone.",0
Perhaps achally send emails to glow accounts with a code and perhaps you should start looking at how to fix your app when logging on in other places.,0

The audio wasn't audible enough.,1
"Good app, especially official use, but some time, its diificult to find some one in the app... If that is the one fixed it could have 5 star.",2

No issues with call quality from wifi over broadband. Very simple install.,2
Consumes lesser data : Great feature But teachers are mentally torturing students by taking single lecture for more than an hour. Please limit the maximum meeting time to 45 minutes. All the Indian students will be very thankful to developer. We surely give it 5 star rating.,0

"When I turn on camera and share it in the meeting, it cannot be seen by other people in the meeting. However when I tried to use it through laptop, it was able to share my camera. Please fix this issue as conducting meetings through phone is convenient.",1
No longer syncs read messages with desktop probably,1
Just for fun,2
"Very easy to utilize. I am new to utilizing this app, but very reliable the 3 times I have utilized it. It is a great opportunity to hear presentations remotely when I am unable to attend onsite.",2
Easy access and no interruptions on audio or video unlike other meeting apps. So far its top of my list.,2
Nice experience,2
"Quality is extremely spotty. Often hard to hear people. The interface doesn't come close to the functionality and simplicity of the newer apps like zoom, etc.",0

Excellent,1
Lots of network problem,1
Superb app,0
Could not get on with audio on my phone no matter the settings.,0
Okay,2
"Its a good app as an appointment setter,  but I would not use it for conferencing since it does not use data, it still a legacy app that tie into the cellular silos.  Setup or monitor your conferences and use the service online with Google+ Thats what I have setup for my Organization.  Also for techies and developers,  join.me is much better",2
"I have usually faced issue, with this app. After taking update for this app, failed to access app, continuously, loader is loading and nothing happen. Then after uninstall and reinstalling able to access athis app. Please do the needful, if this issue occur to many.",2
So you are telling me that I cannot watch youtube or run any other app in the front while attending classes on this app. Because everytime I do the audio gets disconnected in the span of 3 minutes. You guys fix that and take my 5 stars because there's nothing more I expect from a video conferencing app. And yeah this issue happens in the pocket mode aswell which is literally made to run the app in background.,0
"App is very good, if an option for muting the Mike of participants provided for the organiser or host that will be useful to avoid disturbances from participants, please look into it it will be very useful, hope you will come with that update also soon",2

Nice app and would have given 5 stars except for the fact that you don't allow for virtual backgrounds on the Samsung Galaxy A7 Tablet. You have virtual backgrounds on Galaxy A71 mobile phone but not on the companion Tablet? Makes no sense.,1
Cannot join a meeting,0
"In this app some problems are there. For that I am giving 4 stars. Also,not showing the name of the person who removed another person.",1
good,2
Good,1
Doesn't work with Optus. My whole bloody work has changed to it. I cannot even access to take days off or see my shifts. This is the worse app ever developed. Thank you for developing your stupid app. I hate you,0
Ok,0

Unless I am mistaken all attendees need to be in the synched address book. Often I need to invite people who are not in my address book but there seems to be no way to invite people on the fly. Please post a correction if I am mistaken.,1
Does the same thing as the site,2
NOT At all GOOD this app doesnt let us chat with participants of the meeting privately i.e. u r letting the organiser to disable chat.😠😡😤,0
Meetings are a nice and easy experience with this app.,2
I wasn't able to log in with my main email address and was told I have to use another email address I used when first signing in. Anoying.,0
"Often I get only audio, video meeting in going on and the app shows me that no screen or cameras are being shared. Yes I have very good internet connection, still I don't get the video. This is really disappointing 😑",0
Horrible experience.,0
It was a good first visit. Just wish I could see more of my son. The video picture is very limiting. Lots of blurred areas. Good sound quality though.,2
It crashes and kicks me out in b/w calls.,1
Choppy audio/video with great wifi connection on my end. At one point I lost everyone with the program just making circles and nothing happening.,0
Great App.,2
Why business email is too needed if I have team with work on my facebook page. Why I can't login with facebook 😠😠.,0

Great app for business,2
Thumbs down,0
Great quality video chat. Super easy to set up.,2
My Oneplus 7 Pro was updated to Android 11 and every app works fine except Teams. I can open it a few times and then it starts going haywire. Loading and blanking out on chats over and over again. I have to reboot my phone to get it to work properly only to have the cycle repeat after using it a few times.,0
"Although the app does it's job just fine, I'll just mention a thing that I guess everyone wants microsoft to do with not just the Android app, but with teams itself: remove the option of removing people from the meeting for participants. Only the organizers should be allowed to remove. Same goes for muting. It causes extreme inconvenience. Either do this or display the name of the remover. Will highly appreciate it!",1
It takes very much data to turn on video,1
Dropped in and out at times however I was able to hear and get communication at times that were most important.,2
"I felt very sad at the end of the meeting because it brought back into my mind I COULDN'T HELP CHRISTINE. My 6 closet friends all died of CANCER. I only have my Son ,and one close friend left, and the lockdown has meant I've not been able to see my close radio amateur friend for months. Not good. God bless you all. Mike",1
Very good👍 Proper way of digitalized work securing accuracy!,2

Provide recording features without permission of host,0
"Couldn't maximize the window where people were speaking when there were no slides to view. I could only see the person talking if I went landscape mode, and then they were tiny and couldn't be maximized.

First use and awesome. No distractions throughout. You can improve on the audio to be louder. Sheers.,1

Okay it's been a long has the 27th now and that rude comment that you made after the  bad review... bitchy but covering it up with a nice tone.   You guys need to chill out and take your tiara off and put it back on the dresser because you're not Facebook. You had a great product and application. Day 1 I was so impressed and then Evernote to hear so far with great.  You guys need to get rid of,0
Should be more than just a webapp.,0

"This app has been helping people to work from home and connecting people across the globe amidst pandemic. At the same time, it might stress you out for having too much zoom meetings",2
Please make the UI more intuitive and modern and also pls change the font style of the app,1
"Not good app, classes are there that's why I am using",0
It will be in view mode with speaker on the but the mic is set to phone so no one can hear me and they say I'm way too soft. You need to have mic pick up like speakerphone mode when you're viewing the screen and the speaker is on. Obviously. Frustrating glitch.,1
Why the link is expired after few seconds i don't know why?????,0
Excellent,1
Didn't let me sign in. Software issue. Needed to uninstall and reinstall. Will see what happen next.,0
Easily accessible,2
This is a great app that my company uses constantly and it works amazingly everytime with no problems.,2
"Good overall experience. Text chat works great. Ad hoc groups are killer. Voice quality has been vastly improved. Hardly ever any problem even with multiple audio devices, multiple screens, background noise, switching between desktop and mobile. Many integrations handled well. Hard to find anything to complain about. Inline editing in text chat is sometimes buggy when there is formatting or multiple lines in one message.",2
Ok,1
Nice app but sometimes not gives you to create link for meetings,2
It's very good,2
Excellent,2
I haven't try the video conference,2
Nice app but the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars because it consumes a lot of data in one meeting. It consumes upto 500mb or so in just 45 to 60 minutes. Although it is easy to use but consumes a lot of data. Please fix this by providing some options such as to choose the quality of the video call in the meeting. Thanking you,0
Easy to use even for those of us who are technically challenged! Need to add virtual background options,1
Well,0
I will give it 5 if the following problem are fixed first I use it for online meeting classes etc but the pass code is coming wrong usually it is right but secondly my signals are full but still connecting problem and microphone problem plz fix it thank you,1
This is the best meeting app!! As far I have used but it should have hindi captions for hindi classes. I would like to rate 5 stars if.. hindi captions are added.,1
Please reduce the number of asking for a code out of nowhere. It's irritating.,1
Google meet is nice 😨👎,0
cuts off every now and then very poor network connection... but it is of such big help. just needs to be improved even the sound.,1

Best,2
Voice is breaking. Very frequently.,0
"Very nice, so much useful. Very clear audio and video",2
Many times we are getting msg like ' sorry. we've run into an issue' and thus not allowing to do anything in app which takes too much time in resolving. And the recordings that is saved in chat is disappearing after 20 days so that's feature is something we are not finding good,1
"Hello, this app works well but I have a problem. Due to issues with my headphones I usually select ""phone"" as the audio settings. But when I do so, the screen blanks out whenever the front camera area is covered (even with my hands). Please resolve this.",0

This app is so confusing....why it's not showing my profile on my phone while I have the right profile showing on my computer? What's happening?,0
Very cumbersome app. Was trying to listen on my phone and app would not work with my speaker so the only way I could hear the meeting was by holding phone to my ear. I don't recommend this app. Many other apps work much better.,0
Friendly and easy to use.,2
Too heavy memory 72MB. Shpuld bring a lite version like Eleet.,0

"One thing about my experience was that the video feed kept shifting from person to person, in a random, unorganized way. Plus, the more people that talk on the video conference, the harder it is to hear any sound at all. at least that is the way it is with phones, but I do not know how this app works on computers. Finally, this app could include functions that allow pictures and videos to be shown, in an organized way.",2

Disturbing inbetween voices whenever anyone joins or leaves. Requires high amount of data with uninterrupted coverage,0
Needs improvement The mobile version does not allow me to Set a Meeting WITH a password. I have to use PC version if I want a meeting with a Password. For.some stupid reason I have to enter the Password twice: to set a meeting and again TWICE to start a meeting. Why?? Waste of time.

Can't use on tablet untill the afternoon. This morning it was working but now it says my device is not supported. Please can you help?,1
One star for a good product but an app that is truly not an app. I don't understand how this can even get to the Play store.,0
The app now requires a code via text before I can answer calls or respond to messages. The caller hangs up before the process can complete. It won't remember device or stay logged in. Very frustrating. MSFT can do better.,0
Please contact Facebook,2
It is good app,1
Light years ahead of it's replacement (Skype). It is still in some need of some gui improvements but I suspect that will happen. It's kind of hard to cram all that stuff into one window.,2
It's a good app we use this for our class my problem is the change background is not showing..... And when i present on my PHONE it doesn't make sound like its my only device i dont have a computer... and when i full screen my teachers presentation my face will show on the other side i wish you can remove it cause sometimes there something important there but my freaking face showing there pls.... Make this app even better,1
Nice except for the audio,2
So if you are like a teacher or you have a office or anything like it than this app is great for you and it is litrely way better than zoom or meet or any other app. For me as a student it is very easy to access asingments or grades or to chat with the group. So the reason behind this 4 star ⭐ is that when ever I call someone and add another person (from chat call) I makes a new group so that's it.I would say it's a low mb master blaster app. I highly recommend it to you.,2
Good but iam fetched some network issue in this app,2
When we were doing distance learning my kids teachers used this app to meet up and everything. It's been a great tool for my kids to interact with their teachers and peers.,2

Bandwidth hog. Someone explain to Microsoft that not everyone has access to high speed internet all the time. Allow me to specify my video size to be as small as possible. It typically isn't necessary anyway.,0

Not easy to use. Instructions are none existent when joining a meeting. Zoom you can join & it's all right there no familiarity of the program is needed. This you need to study it before attempted use & then the instructions stink.,1
After recent update this app is not working properly. It's just popout the screen again and again ...,1
Can't find a secure connection. BS,0
Good Apps,1
"Awful. Can't use Bluetooth for audio, none of the settings work, won't allow me to log in properly. Terrible app.",0
Good app,2
Always lagging and causing problems for other people in our group meetings. It really kind of messed up the whole experience of being in a rehab group.,0
Majority of the time during my classes/meetings the connection is s#####! And my classes are like super duper IMPORTANT AND I NEED TO BE ABLE TO NOT HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH THE WHOLE CONNECTION! LIKE THE AUDIO WILL BE BREAKING UP AND ILL ONLY HEAR BITS AND PIECE OF MY CLASS IN THE BEGINNING AND IN THE OTHER QUARTER OF MY CLASS THE VIDEO IS F###ED UP AND I AM REQUIRED TO HAVE MY VIDEO ON SO MY INSTRUCTOR CAN SEE FOR HIMSELF THAT I AM OKAY.... PLEASE TELL ME YOU CAN GET THIS FIGURED B4 WEDNESDAY?!😞,1
"Nice app. But I can't use backgrounds in mobile which can be used in laptops. Again, I want to record meeting in mobile.",2

Good but one thing i didn't like is No flashlight😀,2
Very poor.. Can't install,0
Ok,0
Good for distance education,2
Good app to use for video communication. But everytime for every week it gets updated with a lot of mbs. It is the only app having a large mb space.,1
I didn't like the updated version old one was better,0
While meeting is going the up side bars are appearing so that screen is not visible properly.Plz improve that,1
Good app for Enterprise but the interface is bit complex which makes interfaces response slow. It would be good if they just build it on normal FB UI/UX,1
"Please updates often, so make more easier for user to operate this app",2
Iwhsg,1
"I think it lacks some ""good to have"" behavioural; would like to have more control of the device when I'm in a meeting, like separated audio channels from the ""call"" and other device's outputs. There is also little responsiveness when using it in ""popup"" mode.",1
Good 👍🌻👌,1
"The app doesn't work with bluetooth, making it useless for me. I need to use the browser on my phone-Google Pixel 4. I enjoyed the app on my iPhone but until they fix the bluetooth problem with Android, I will have to delete it off my phone.",0

I will give this app 3 stars because this apps contains lots of bugs like a have a full speed 5G net but sometimes it only shows connecting but it didn't connect and we got disconnect by this app and this app says why you disconnect soo early please fix these bugs otherwise it's a nice app to study,1
This has been such a blessing to me!,2
"The connection process is difficult, and in some cases impossible with a meeting link. The inconsistent performance of the app is astounding given that it is a Microsoft product. I would recommend better testing on the developer end.",1

Pain to use on personal phone.... Irritating to sync calender with phone.. annoying to be stuck with encryption and not using pattern... HATE IT... Sorry guys... You asked me for reviewing again,1

Very slow app. it consumes lot of data.,0
"As a lot of other users already highlighted, the app is absolutely useless. You can't join others' rooms - only if all on your team registered within a single team. It means - your clients, friends, or colleagues new to whereby will not be able to join. I couldn't connect to other dept meeting even tho I was invited So I used web on mobile. And, believe me or not - it doesn't work even in chrome (android). No sound, no opportunity to see what others share Not to mention it's just a wrapped web",0
It's good but could use improvements. In particular as an avid Samsung DEX user I was very disapointed I could not use this app in DEX mode on a full-size monitor. It only shared the screen on my phone rather than on the monitor.,1
Nice,1
Best for prank rais 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,2
Without taking permission this app turns our video and microphone on so please fix this bug.,0
Loved so much😍😍😍😍,2
Perfect app for meeting,1

The application consumes too much data in very short period of time during any video presentation. Pls fix this issue,0
"Where virtual background tools, after update, this feature disappear",0
Absolutely terrible! It is super slow both on the phone and laptop. Has crashed my laptop multiple times and I have decent RAM and processing power. I will definitely be using alternative software for virtual meetings,0
Amazing app..love it...I hope you can add some features for android users like changing the background and blurring the background itself in Android phones🙏❤️,2
This app is very nice and easy to use! especially the cute background... I really like this app!!🥰🥰🥰🤍🤍🤍👍👍👍👍,2
It fails to get updated frequently. Everytime I have to uninstall app and install again. I am forced to use it by my organization. Otherwise I ll never use it again 23.12.2021- Reinstalling again just because this couldn't get me signed in. It keeps loading. Totally frustrating.,0
Worst,0
This app is good for students to attend online lecture but one problem I was facing is that after attending 3–4 meeting back to back of 40 minutes each it drains too much battery (almost 8–10% in one meeting) and also my phone is new so there is no battery problem in my device so I request to the devlopers to fix this and this is the only one problem I was facing and maybe also others else I have rated this app 5 stars,2
Nice,2

Quality perfected at a ridiculously low price with the best on hold music you'll ever hear on a conference call... And the ultimate luxury of not having a pin that sounds like a social security number for particular calls if that is your desire,2

"I was a first time user & was originally overwhelmed by all of the different options & directions. Also, I was attempting to use a ""smart"" phone which gave me limited screen usage. I would suggest that there be a test setup & a dummy call for novices; that way we can get practice before our actual conference call. We could also work out any kinks with our equipmemt. UPDATE: 6/17/20 I've used the system frequently over the past month. The system is a good option for those w/limited screen size.",2
Now it is good but only one problem when i share my screen the sound is not audible pls fix it and now i love this app,2

Very clear call! No issues whatsoever and it's a great to way to hold groups meetings,2
It would be nice if pictures could be shared. Also being able to reply to a specific message. Overall this is an excellent app. God bless the person who came up with this idea 💡 🙏🏾 🙌🏽,2

It should focus on the chat with the new message not the last response.. It also allows you to join meetings you have not been invited to or confirm acceptance of invite but it does not track these meetings fully... it should behave like meetings properly accepted and attended.,1

Bad and Worst App. Everytime it tells you to sign in when I attend meetings through links and putting corect credentials also it doesn't allow me to go ahead. One of the worst and flop apps of microsoft in year 2021. It will never progress. I curse you Steve Jobs for this act.,0

I'm shocked the ability to mute all notifications when you are listed as out of office is not available or to even turn off notifications entirely (yes, you can handle that at the system level but it should be included in the app settings). IMO, that should be an obvious feature to allow people to enjoy their vacations without getting the normal messages.",0

I love the app. Its neat and tidy and easy to navigate. And its super duper on data & power saving compared to other conferencing apps. I use it for all my meetings.

Very good app. Handy especially during a time of being socially distanced.,2
fine,1
"Overall really good performance. But sometimes the UI really confusing. I mean we can turn on and off camera in the floating screen is a good feature but if you make it too big, sometimes i turn on my camera without intended to do so.

Everything in the app is good but the layout is not great and one more that background changing option is also not visible,1

1. Add 'rotate screen manually' option to rotate whenever need in accordance to view without changing device's screen rotation settings. This will help too much. 2.

It's a good app but they should fix by the now the concern about hearing the audio or the video when presenting. It can only be done on computers but not on tablets and mobile phones. I tried to do it a lot of times but it seems like you can only share the screen but not the audios of the presentation.,2

Generally teams are a decent app. But who oh who both the buttons for mic on/off and the sound volume slider and on/off buttons aren't always visible for the user wile conferencing. Also joining conference either without any sound whatsoever or with both mic and sound? why not give the user the ability to join with sound only? That's rubbish interface design.,1

"This is by far the worst experience I've had with any website/app/solution as a whole. I could write an essay on all the bugs and UX nightmares (spanning across all clients: Windows, MacOS, Android and Linux alike). I've used Alpha release software more stable than Teams. What really grinds my gears is that it seems to be deteriorating instead of improving. Instead of letting bad devs go, it seems like Microsoft just moves them to the Teams dev team.",0
Great App! Go To Meeting is a Very Convenient way to attend my Meetings while I'm at home or on the Go!!!,2
"Chat, groups and being able to join meetings on the go works great. But it is ridiculous that you cannot stop calls and meeting requests from ringing on the phone. I hid the notification which made it worse, now it just rings with no way to answer or reject. Until you can turn off calls, this will continue to cause more harm than worth.",0
As a student I feel that there must chat option in video call. Because when someone disturb the class what teacher do is they disabled mice due to which all sincere student have to suffer. If there must be chat option through which we can only privately chat with the organisers. NO CHAT OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO CHAT WITH FRIENDS. Through this if we know the name of the student who are repeatedly disturbing the class we can send the names private ly to the organisers and can settle the issue.,0
Zoom awesome very effective easy fast communicatiln wonderful service that brings people together,2

"Very poor! I have fast speed Internet but sound quality poor! Much improvement made to this app Jan 23/2021!!! Thank you for all the improvements. Quality is great! Oct 24, 2021.",2
"The application is really well done, easy to use and flexible. Compared to Google Meet, is MUCH more stable and enjoyable (but heavier as well). The sole defect lays in the fact that you cannot quit a Team once you've joined it (or, at least, it can't be done intuitively). Its integration with Google Calendar for scheduled meeting is very comfortable.",2

Very good,2

"Not the best app for general use, but if it's cooperating, it gets the job done. App is extremely slow and does not function like the other big time video meeting apps. Better experience using software on the computer. It seems like developers are trying to catch up and make the app comparable in functionality to competitors but couldn't quite catch the wave.",0
It's not working in laptop. When we try to login in calendar it says couldn't sink try again later.,0

I can't find a way to turn off the very annoying and distracting tone every time anyone joins or leaves a meeting which makes it difficult to hear and focus on the actual meeting! Otherwise a great app!,0

If I get an email or a message later in the afternoon I can glance at it right on my phone and prepare for what I have to deal with first thing the next morning, also leaving me more time to think about the issue and come up with a better solution. Super convenient and user friendly!! There are a few bugs here and there but nothing worth noting. Great app, love it!!",2

The app has sound issues where one persons voice is too quiet and then the voice doesn't even come threw so I'll see their mouth moving but no sound. And it seems to gave a hard time connecting to internet steadily matter how strong the signal is and the picture freezes randomly as well. I prefer Zoom!

"This was my 1st time using this app, I had expected the call to be much clearer than it was. I didn't feel it was very user friendly. The controls do not appear to be clearly marked as to whether they are on or off when initially joining the mtg. I made the mistake of joining a very large meeting already in progress and it took to long to find whether or not my mic was on or off. Also I felt it would be more beneficial to have the chat option on the same panel with the mic.",1

I enjoy it,2
"Good app for my classes. But still not good. When my teacher asks to answer something, and when I answer, my teacher cannot hear it. Another issue is that even when the network is good, network problems happen. I get left out of the meeting everyday after some time of the starting of the class. When I join again, then another clone of my name, profile and account appears. Please make this app better.",1
Please make this app compatible for 1GB ram.,1
Host audio quality was very poor,0
Good app for working remotely,2
"I was very excited about this service when I found it. It was exactly what I needed and the promotional video nailed it! I installed and tested out some the features. Wow, pretty cool.  Unfortunately, when I finally used it on an actual conference call with a client, the service (I was using it from the browser) crapped out on me several times. What an embarrassment! I do not know exactly what caused the issue but I couldn't hear the client but the client could hear me (some muting issue) and so I had to call back in. After the second time, I stop using Uber and just called the client directly since there was only two parties on the call this time.  Now, I have to reconsider my options until this is resolved and I have the confidence again in the service. Bummer.",0
Very good,2
"Adequate communicator, but not as good as others. Lately when using the app to text the top of the keyboard obscures my typed message. Also frequently when sending photos the recipient can't view them, broken image shows. Not the case with other messaging apps i use.",1
Is awesome app it is the best one have you so for please keep up the good work,2
"It was hard for me to login, i ended up missing a Video Court date, thank goodness they rescheduled my appointment & didnt recieve a Warrant ! Amen...",1

Good Application.,2
"I use for my online classes. My only issue is having to open the chat box, I use it a lot during some classes but the current app means losing the entire view of the screen. Would be great if the chat box could open on the right, allowing me to type and still view what's being display on screen.",2
"In all the communication options, I find this UI the most intuitive, the browser or App utility easier than loading a massive hunk of software to computer, communication quality good and price (free) right",2

"I like this app and the service behind it. It's a reinvention of conference calling. But as brilliant and innovative as it is, there is a lack of polish. They need some loyal critics who will help smooth out the minor issues.",2

1st time user. So far great app using to use #1 point. Video was very slightly glitchy at some points but that might have been my Internet connection so if I had to use it more often and it wasn't the app for sure I'd rate it 5 stars but for now I give it 4.,2

"This app ok for the most part. The only thing is I wish the mobile app allowed us to see everyone's camera during a conference call. On apple, you can see everyone on the mobile app but on the android, you can only see the person. Please fix this!",1

"It's a great app. Very useful for online classes, but i really would like to ask to put their facebook/google/or any other account on show. Sometimes in our class, a person shows up that isn't a part of the class and will start saying profanities. We'd like to know who it is but we don't know since their account don't show. So, please, make people's account showable and not so private.",1

The Desktop version of GTM is great but the Android app is rather limited. I plan to use this app to help low income clients and it is important that their can show their documents to me via screen sharing. Most of my clients cannot afford laptops or iOS devices. It will be nice if your Android version can measure up with the rest fleet.,0

"Have to take a star away. I work from my tablet pretty regularly and am in meetings a lot.

Well done,2
Audio is disconnected frequently and my device is heating up whenever l use webex,1

Zoom should improve the functioning of this app.,0
So so,2
It is a very good app but sometimes when another speak the voice is cut if this problem will solve then the app will be good,2

"Video is always fuzzy, audio can only be through speaker mode on my phone. This is like the discount version of zoom. Apparently if you pay for the upgraded version it matches zoom capability but I haven't tried.",0
4 stars because you should add the Private message option in chats like the Zoom app or people will download Zoom more. Thanks.,2

This is very bad app Google meet is much better and easy to use than this trash. First problem is this app is not easy to use. Second is only host can present the screen. Third is that it rotates i have kept off rotate from phone setting then also why this app rotates screen which i dont want. I will reccomend Google meet.,0
Great way to communicate as a team especially when we were working remotely from home.,2
I can't make it to see everyone at the same time. I can see only the person speaking at the moment,0

Poor audio quality and video doesn't work all the time.,1
No words to say wonderful app 👌 But it's take every time that ___ is asking to join when I create a metting a hundred of that messages come and my phone lag that's why I give 3 stars,1
Very easy to use and during this pandemic it is the only way to keep going on your classes,2
It should have facility to record the audio or screen recorder so that the missing contents could be clear later,2
I signed in and was waiting for my video call. They called several times but app never rang. No notification of missed call either. I signed into the web version on a computer and had no problems.,0
I am only giving 4 star because could you add an another option for not turn offing the camera for the host. But please do not add an another option to not turn offing the mic.,1
Sometimes when we update it not login quickly..it take 2 days ..rest is good,2

"Constant audio issues. App won't route audio through a Bluetooth headset and won't even use the loudspeaker. It won't switch between internet and phone call audio reliably, and routinely drops audio to very low levels that can't be fixed without disconnecting and closing the app.",0
Good 👍,2
"Overall, I am happy with the MS Teams app. The MAJOR FLAW of the app is that there are NO webcam setting options! No option to adjust the brightness, contrast, color, backlight comp, enhance my appearance, and studio settings (adding makeup, hats, masks, and fun decorations.) The lighting in my office changes constantly, so I must reset my webcam settings with every video meeting via a time-consuming and circuitous workaround. PLEASE add ""adjust webcam"" ASAP so I can change this to 5 stars!",2
Good,0
"Helpful, has made therapy appointments way easy and more accessible to myself and others in my family. Life-changing for sure!",2
Absolute nightmare. Every single week I have to uninstall and reinstall the app because I can't log in because my Microsoft account that I've had for over 10 years and that I use every single day can't be found. Absolutely furiating,0

Zoom app should get an update when the scheduled meeting starts. This will automatically activate an auto call system or alarm system and start the meeting without fail for the customer or person.,1

You should change the effects option in Mobile phones also why did not you make it like a laptop when you go in general there should come option otherwise I will complain to developer,0

Innovative but with slow processes The app should be more lite with the features because some of the users of the app could face lagging problems or slow processes.,1
It was very helpful i learnd alot about what i need to do to get started on being a first time home buyer,2
Good app but some features are still missing. 1. A webapp for smartphones is surely needed. 2. The teams calendar does not sync with the native calendar on the smartphone. Hence you can't use widgets to check your schedule on your phone. Hope they fix this.,1

Keeps crashing,0
It always glitches,0
I cannot join other room than which was created under my account? Useless than,0
Just the thought is great. Definitely can be used for both businesses,2
Major Problem - there should be an option to make only one screen in spotlight (enlarged screen) while there are multiple participants in a meeting. It's difficult for teachers to create online classes while they're writing on board & they want to show the board to students but students can't make teacher's screen full screen even though other participants video is off. This feature needs to be added as soon as possible.,0
It is getting better. It may be my phone. But it was going in and out with the Audio . Was not able to see the speakers when they spoke. I am so glad you had a dial in. The session was really great. Willola.,1

"Slow and a major battery hog. With Teams running in the background my batter drops 1% per minute. Without teams it is 10% per hour (1% every 6 minutes). Its utterly bonkers. Nothing like that with Whattsapp or Telegram. It obviously is very inefficient and poorly written. It can take 10+ seconds to switch to the app and the in-app chat often does not update unless I switch away and then back, whilst the incoming messages do get shown as notifications in android. A shame, as has potential.",0

The updated version is not good...i can't see the screen sharing and a persons video at the same time...which makes ie very difficult for me to attend my classes smoothly... please de update it!!!,1
Very useful,2

Bad user interface and Cannot hear other audios while its put in the background 👎,0
"I'm not happy.I have to do homework which include: reading tasks etc.However,I am not allowed to access my tasks,files or even powerpoints!",0
Simple & straightforward. Has sufficient functionality for a presentation that requires interaction within a group of 30. Stable platform.,2
Facing voice echoing issue for me and other side person can't hear my voice. Other apps video calls working fine.,0
The most unstable and unreliable app by MS. Won't let me sign in wih my account. Background changes were removed when I could sign in earlier. Missing out on major meetings because of this nuisance. Terrible MS!,0
"Universal webcam app. No need to sign up for you or your friend. Create name of chat room and that will become the url. Invite your friend to join you through sms, messenger, fb + more, all they need to do is click the link and you will instantly be connected. You can choose to hide video and/ or mute sound and you can just chat by typing. It's the best!",2
It's pretty good. The Join feature doesn't work from the meeting-started notification.,2
"I'm not sure why you are using this app if your a company, Facebook is for comsumer, not companies. The app acts exactly like Facebook does, just with more security for groups and such. It's the Facebook you know but just with a different layout",0
This app is very good and I have been using it for long time for My online classes.,2
"Moved from Slack to Teams. Function is great, chat streams are effectively managed. Could use an update to the emoji/gif category as we use those to a great extent.",1
It was an nice experience 💥,2

"I love zoom app but when I start the meeting and after 40 minutes, the meeting was over. They said that I will need to upgrade to pro but I don't know how to upgrade so please tell me how to do it.",1

"Very worst app I ever seen like this it consumes lot of internet, for 1 second it consume 10 KB, for 2 hours it takes 1 GB of my internet. Thank you for the response, but it should be better that the users also can choose what to see at the time of class, I found that once the organisers turn on the video it consumes lot of internet, better to have a separate option for the users to choose which screen they want to see.",0
Without a wifi connection my phone overheats when the app is running and no other apps are running in the background. Also it would be nice for a photo share option be in the chat area.,1
I have the updated version but still it's not showing me the virtual background option.,0
"Excellent service, very clear sound",2
I was very surprised that the audio and visual were above fair. I will consider using this app in the future.,2

It take's a lot of memori on my PC and when I close the p if somebody send's a message it opens again and the call's man I can't change the sound for some dumb reason but the good side of Zoom is that I can talk to my friend's even though Discord does a better jog there's the bad and good in thing's so hopefully in future updates it will become better.,2
"I can't able to download this app,i am trying past from 1 week it's not downloading",0
This App is really good. I just gave it 4 stars because they should add a feature of messaging someone in meeting personally. I request to please add this feature.,2

"Works great. Not much to say. Functionality easy, video quality clear.",2
Plagued with app breaking bugs,0
"Lacking in features available on other devices, I'm using a Samsung tablet and what would be most useful is the gallery option, to see just 4 participants is frustrating as if you need to see someone who is 3 or 4 scrolls away you miss what is being shown etc.",1
"The app cannot be trusted. Voicemail notifications without a voicemail, and new chat messages not appearing while I'm in the chat (need to go to the chat list and refresh to see them). These are the core scenarios for the app, and they are broken. Very disappointing, Microsoft.",0

"A lot better than google meet and zoom apps. Very user friendly. Bug report: THE MIC AUTOMATICALLY TURNS ON AFTER CLICKING RETRY FOR MEET AUDIO TO FUNCTION EACH TIME AFTER USING YOUTUBE, MUSIC APPS. THIS MAKES I HAVE TO MANUALLY SWITCH IT OFF EACH TIME WHEN EVER I REOPEN THE APP.",2

It's a wonderful app l request you to add a suitable background for its users.,2
1st time using it and 2nd time using a meeting app. I used zoom before. Did not see the thing to click to write out a chat message. Using it on a LG android phone. Audio and video good. Just seemed cumbersome with the layout design.,1
Great app to have interview,2

Difficult getting bluetooth in car to work.,0
"My meeting kept breaking up on either my network or theirs. Mine's never had an issue. Then, we lost video but still had voice on my side. I'm very disappointed that I Googled this before my meeting and read that you simply have to click on the invite to join without downloading, but got stuck downloading anyway. False information on the web concerning this program. Uninstalled.",0
"App works but has many flaws: - cannot turn off incoming video from presenters on mobile devices, which not only consumes network bandwidth, but also takes half the device screen realstate for content being presented when ALL I want to watch is the content and not the presenter. - audio doesn't reconnect automatically when using internet audio and when devices switches to wifi from cel network. - Consumes too much battery.",1

L update on the 27th firestarter add a comment to a bad review here and they are little fire starters aren't they? Okay it's been a long has the 27th now and that rude comment that you made after the  bad review... bitchy but covering it up with a nice tone.   You guys need to chill out and take your tiara off and put it back on the dresser because you're not Facebook. You had a great product and application. Day 1 I was so impressed and then Evernote to hear so far with great.  You guys need to get rid of,0
The greatest strength is that I can have Teams for different accounts all in one app. There is a learning curve because sometimes the functionality is a little clunky. It has gotten better.,2

"I have attended online classes using other web meeting apps and if I ever lose connectivity, I am usually kicked out and must reconnect. With Webex, when I lost internet connectivity, my position was held so long as i did not close the app, until I was able to regain signal. This is especially helpful since my course does not allow reconnectivity after 30 minutes into the 3 hour course. For this reason I give you 5 stars.",2
Good app but I do not have baground.I am using tab.They should update it for baground,2
post mandatory sign up the apps unusable,0
It just works and works well.,2
Works well for presentations and meetings where content sharing is required. As a presenter it is easy to miss questions from participants via chat,2
This is really much more better than other things. Flexible to the user.,1
"Speaking with nearly 2 years experience, if there's something to avoid, it's this. In March to June 2020 it only worked on my laptop and in September to April 2020/2021 it only worked on my phone. All messages were late coming and going through for students and staff. PowerPoints, microphones etc. were messed up for everyone for the whole last academic year. Now during meetings people can't hear me and I can't write in the chat...it went from being bad to being the all time worst thing ever.",0

Wonderful to have Zoom in our life..Digital meetings..product promotion and connecting people is so much easier.,2
Why the hell did this app register to open .backup files on my phone? Super sketchy. Also really hard to log in and associate my accounts together. And why wouldn't a meeting I've connected to before (like a previous week) that's in progress now show up in possible meetings to connect to? Trash.,0
It stopped allowing me to schedule conference calls.... Not happy at all I tried uninstalling and reinstalling still nothing.,0

Today the internet was consumed like anything...it took 1.5 gb in just an hour...everyday it takes 300-500mb and today it took my whole internet of 1.5 gb Please resolve the issue,0
"It works, albeit not well. Notifications can be fickle, messages just don't show up, you constantly get logged out, and of course the keyboard regularly opens on top of the input box for chat. It works. Just feels like an half-baked platform.",1
"Used once. Stable and simple. Only mini gripe is the placement of my picture, I'd like to move it wherever I want or completely remove it. Would use again if I needed.",2
Sound quality is better in MS teams.,1
Super,0
"Worst app . Low voice quality,low Video quality,buffering problem .",0
In My Device there is no background option on which version will I get background option I need it for online class,1
"Everything has been great for me apart from the fact that I cannot see the background filter options on my s21 ultra. I updated, reinstalled, nothing works. The button appears on my note 8 but missing on the s21 ultra. Also using the screen overlay with camera on makes the s21 ultra go to 60hz refresh rate. Hopefully this can be fixed in the future.",2
Good,2
Nice App but I want it to be on premium,1
I have given 4.0 stars because there is no option Of visual effects in my meet and I am using the latest version but the option of visual effect is not coming what is the solution of this problem.,2
"Not sure why this app exists. Like others have said, it would make sense if this would allow you to be part of your conference call as it you were signing in through your computer. As I  never ""dial in"" to my own conference calls - the Uber Conference Desktop / Laptop Chrome plugin activates my mic and speakers - this android app is less than useless.",0
Nice,2
This app is quick efficient and gets the message across. I like the location and attachment featured too.,2

WHEN EVERYONE TURNS ON CAMERA NETWORK ISSUE OCCURS,1
"App is pretty slow, on a Pixel 4A 5G. Sometimes content or chats doesn't even load on the first attempt. Have to go out of the chat then come back into the chat and that resolves the loading issue.",1
It is a worst app I have used.poor call and connection quality.it drains battery life.there were no chat options.i am very unsatisfied with this app.,0
Please delete it it's not for kids.,0
"Great app for meetings for myself. There r no problems in meet,but only one problem to say that there should be a option to change background in android phone also and not only in laptop or computer.",2
When i keep my Camera on for even 5 to 20 minutes . I automatically get leave . The app is good and well working but camera is main problem.Plz fix it,2
"Great app! but i suggest to make a way to talk to some student privately, like in real world classroom where you and your friend can talk, say greetings and ask questions without messing up with the whole audience.",2

"This app is really joke. So you want to use notifications from Teams, to know if someone wrote something to you. And you've installed Teams on your phone to get ones. And you received notifications about chat, calls, meetings... but day after or notification about some message you had read and wrote some answer 2h ago on PC. I've never used such poor chat app on phone. And I've tested many. Shame for so huge corp like Microsoft.",0
Very good and reliable app,2
Crashes as soon as I open the app,0
"I work for a company that has probably around the area of 2,000 if not more people using this app I get notifications on my phone anywhere from 8 hours to as many as 3 days after a post is posted not very impressed with this app",2
"I can't use the app on my phone, because I cannot hear audio from others despite all the settings changes I've made. But, its also very useful n easy to use on laptop. However, sometimes it's more practical to use it on mobile phone, but I can't.",1
Workplace is a huge step forward.,2
"Clear video and voice, It will be more convenient if Chatting page is available in home page itself.",2
Repeatedly voice breaking,1

App does not allow you to turn on or off speaker on phone. Big miss. I avoid using this app because of that.,0
"Could not get a full screen of presenter. I had my video and mike muted, but my rectangle with my initials filled half the screen.

"Works well on all of my devices (Mac Air, iPad, iPhone Pro Max 12, & Samsung Note 8). Thank you!",2
Nice app but sometimes in calendar it don't show the periods,1
Speaker sound has improved in this updatw. UI view of list of previous meetings attended is still poor.,2
Super glitchy. Delayed video. Glitchy audio. I could see the person but couldn't understand half the conversation.,0
Complicated and it slows down the computer...my exp.,1

"Sound keeps cutting out if I turn my camera on & it doesn't matter if I use my laptop, my cell, my WiFi or my other internet service. I've tried everything & the service is just terrible.",0

Excellent collaboration tool. Needs to be more intuitive to mobile platforms to get a 5. Almost there,2

There is a lag when people are speaking that I do not see on Zoom.,1
"Works as a basic chat app, but the way it works with Drive and SharePoint and other Microsoft stuff is just beyond confusing. Eg if you share a document in one chat then share the same doc in another chat, it asks you if you want to make a copy or not. That's not enough information! What happens if I have a copy and I update one - are they synchronised? What? There are other examples but holy hell.",0
Pretty good 👍☺️.I really like that they added real time captioning! 👍👍👍☺️,2
Its consuming more data how can we get use it,0
Loved it smooth and better view.,2
It is asking to update and after update it is not opening,0

Good app to use,2

I think it should focus more on stability of the video special when teacher is presenting a slide picture. please do something about this... delays a lot...🤦,0
Ravi hi,2
Ok,1
I really like this app - the calls are clear I have had a few issues with the app not showing me whose on the call.,2
"I am on Zoom daily and l thank God and the creators for this APP. It's a life saver, keeping me in touch with family, friends and my church community. I have attended weddings, anniversary parties, bridal shower, baby shower, power hours and funerals while staying at home during Covid19 reign. So yeah kudos to you Zoom 2020/2021 is your time! Thank you for being here for us all.",2

"The teams app has usually been good. However, it fails to show certain notifications at times and with the new update I have been unable to access it on either my phone or tab. My institution has enabled a sign in verification system. But the sign in issue arose after the July 27, 2021 update",1
It's just an voice call app. I found no option for the video/camera when I have connected through mobile,0
Quality of video is good. Lots of feedback in voice calls with echo. it has never really worked well when it's more than 2 people.,1
Nice facebook work,1
Unable to open any attachments on Android devices.,0

It took over 10 minutes to download onto my phone if it was quicker if would have given more stars,0
Amazing,2
The app is good,0
It's functional but I can't share audio when presenting screen in our television for better view. Even in Bluetooth speaker it's not working. I think the wireless sounds connections are faulty,1
Worst app experience. Consumes a lot of data...almost all data if the meeting is for long hours. There is inbuilt audio problem as well. A great bug.,0
Ee,2
Easy to use,2
"No audio,",0
Works on my smart phone...not on my computer. No one can hear me on/from my computer.,1
Teams is a good app to use daily we are using it in our teams meetings at work and it's great. However it has its shortcomings sometimes we lose connections or we can connect into the meeting and so forth.,2
Can't login to teams for my son's virtual school tomorrow and every friw. Keeps asking for a code they never send....and it was easier just asking g for the password Also app store keeps saying he's signed in when I try to reinstall as well,0
"I really appreciate the developers for making such a good conference call app. I like the voice replys nice addition it's like a professional call conference machine which I like. The features to be able to mute,record,transcripts is good.I just got this app today and I already want to get pro because I don't want to call each and every participant to invite them seems like a time consuming task.  ***However*** I would like to atleast hear the ""hold music"" without having to call just to sample it.",2
Awesome 👍😊,2
"I like it very much with it i can talk to my freinds and do anything with them but when i install it and i join a meeting i open the camera but it didn't open i go to settings but i didn't find anything so please fix this also when i sign in,in day i click on something then i join anthor meeting and i saw that i have log out so i sgin in again with the same email and password but it says to me Invalid email or password",1
cannot find a way to reset password easily really very crappy interface,0
Not able to hear properly,1
Audio was not very clear. Maybe due to attendees mics not being muted.,1
I have no idea. It has a little requirements for perfect.,2
This app used to be good. It no longer works. I'm going to cancel my paid subscription,0
It's very helpful but when using android devices we cannot pause screen share or even mute the mic. Those options are only available on computers. This is really inconvenient to me.,0
It's good,1
They have built a good video conferencing App. One of my friends told me about it as I got a text message to join a meeting and since then I have been using it myself.,2
The app is good but from past few days i am facing problems such as i am not able to pin the video not able to change my Profile picture i would like zoom to resolve it as earlier as possible,1
Nice desktop as well. Need more than 8 people and i'll give 5,2
Very good experience,2
"Have been trying to download the app since last 4 days. Couldn't succeed, not sure if this app is really live or dead",0
Its was very gud before...but nowadays its not working properly during the meeting i got automatically disconnected through the meeting😞its very dissappointing ...it always glitch in between the meeting my teachers aren't able to hear my voice properly..and it takes a very very long time to join in meeting it always show connecting...connecting...😵and when I have been connected it disconnect suddenly🙄,0
Hey..the app is awesome..but prblm is inbetween the meeting automatically disconnecting..and I have to rejoin the meeting again..to rejoin it is taking too much time nearly 5min..😔,2

Really useful. Beautiful interface,2

"the overall experience is great, the audio & video is good most of the time. my only problem is even if the app is up to date, I still couldn't have the backgrounds option. I am looking forward to have a background since it is sometimes needed whenever we conduct a webinars.",1
It is good app my online classes is gone very good but 3stars because the network issues is going on ☺️🖐️👏,1
"I can't add any person in to my team it always sorry, try again later",0

My experience is this app is good,1
This app is good. We can chat with people and make a group out of them and talk. We can join in other meetings. We can invite our friends in the chat and do other things such as upgrade the version into like 5.8.0. I have four members in my Chat and three or four groups.....This app is so good. The first star means I like this app the second star means I have friends in zoom the third star means I have groups in zoom the fourth star means this is a excellent app the fifth star means meetings bye,2
It's nice and comfortable,0

"Thank you very much for your reply! 3⭐ Headphones were used. ""Lower speaker volume"" + ""Mute yourself when not speaking"" are not possible when teaching. 1st review: 1⭐ Thank you very much for the great effort, Dev & Team. Alas, I could not carry out my lessons using your app as there were echoes on different occasions. I had to switch to other apps. No history of calls are kept by your app, either, as though there were never any. I hope that these will be included in future. Thank you very much.",1
I hope that there should be more cams to be seen and the video quality is being not so good and though there is a good wi fi connection it is showing Reconnecting.,2

Not professional video calling app. Zoom and Google meet are far better than this.,0
"Often freezes and is unusable until the phones is restarted. If you are in a chat and lock the phone it does not update that conversation until you back out and go back in. Constantly gives multiple notifications for stuff you've already read, especially on other clients. Voice chat exits if you cross into or out of a known WiFi signal. All stuff that competing services figured out a long time ago",0

There is a bug which prevents joining or hosting a call if connected to WiFi. If trying to connect to the same with WiFi disabled the call no longer drops. This makes the app useless without access to a reliable mobile data connection.,0

Hi Google LLC team. This application is Very Good for online classes. It is really easy to use. I've a suggestion that add a feature in Google Meet (Smartphone) that your meet pc has which is presenting a tab. This would be really useful for mobile users to share the audio and video both of it. -India,2
Very good,2

Not bad in general. Notifications are a mess. I still receive notifications for messages or mentions even if I already read them on the desktop app.,1

Great overview,2
I want to use visual effects on my (android 8 / samsung a5 2017) (dont judge),2
There was an additional audio scrambling in the background when I was speaking very difficult to hear the judge and instead of it being a video I had to actually put the phone to my ear so I could hear what she was saying did not have the same experience the last time I used the WebEx everything went fine and audio and video were clear but this time they were definitely clearly other problems no,1

And I missed many lecs because if this problem. I request zoom to solve this problem pls. #fixourzoom,1
Would be a solid 4 stars if there was an obvious way (or possibly any way) to join a call on speaker. Hard to see a presentation with the phone pressed against your head.,0

"The app is updated and getting improved almost everyday,even it is nicely.The new blue-theme is very nicely made.All the other apps from Google also have changed and the meet is improved since 1.On other app,we can still see the pop up view of our(don't corrupt) 2.Earlier when I first used meet it was a lot laggy but today less.and much more among.So hopefully it improves more and more.good.Just suggesting you is add more settings,add a record system,give the host more options.and copy chat text",2
I love this,1
How did I ever live without Zoom! It's the best!,2

I tried to join back to leave the meeting, but Microsoft Teams said, ""Sorry, we couldn't connect you."" So, every time we had a class. I felt like someone was using my account, and my account was meeting alone in that room. Kinda creepy. I believe that Teams had an error. I hope that Microsoft Teams teams can fix this problem.",0

"It ""works."" By that, I mean it'll accomplish what you need to do but hopefully you don't have to get it done right away. It's nice that Microsoft wants us to slow down and not be in such a hurry. In fact, I do so love the anticipation when I tap the screen, the excitement of wondering ""did it work? Is it going?"" that I really wish they'd build in some delays to make the app even slower! Not. Come on Microsoft it's 2020. Even on low spec phones there's no reason it should be this slow.",0

This app is good to use.,2
Super,1
It's average...can you introduce gallery view on this app...it is not available.and also increase the clearity of screen sharing,0
This aap is excellent. I would rate this a 5 star but there is no background change option in my mobile why there is no background change option in my mobile. Please do something so that background change option comes in my mobile. I need this option.,1
Sound would cut out and video would freeze several times during meeting.,1

This is good app,2
Please add a pin code to the app and it will be 5*,1
I give it two Stars because when we have a meeting in a phone it will not allow us to change the baground and the same goes with tablet. I AM going to compare this app with zoom. Zoom allows us to change baground no matter which device we are attending from and it allows us to See clearly if the persons video is on or off and in Google meet however it is the opposite it will allow us to See if the video is on or off only if you pin them other than that zoom and Google meeting are the same tk you,0

I didn't even open the app,2
Was so excited to use the app.. but first thing upon signing up for it is a warning that I have to upgrade it to business level if I want a Canadian conference call number. I feel duped. If you're only going to be free in the US from the US that's fine but then say it up front not only telling us after we've downloaded the app,0
Nice app 👍,2
Worst app ever It says everytime audio is connecting Ans after connection it disconnected ans tgen the same problem,0

Webex not an intuitive experience. The speakers video is overlayed on the presentation blotting out key points. Couldn't find a way to move it.,1
It's asking me to enter password and otp verification whenever I open the app,0
"Previously application was running smoothly but ,in case of latest update I'm not able to open any file submitted by me in assignment section. Also if a new assignment is mentioned them I am not able to explore reference material of assignment.",0
This apps is so great even I used it for 5 months but there is no lag stuff.But sometimes there was some ghost touch that always turn on the camera and the mic by itself.,2
This app is so helpful you people are doing a great job,1
Experience is nice but some more feature should be added,2
Very complicating. Difficult to join in.,0
The aap is good but in mobile phone we can't change the layout and we cannot change virtual background in mobile phone . Because of it I am giving 3 stars.,1

"Took a min to learn the ins and outs of this app, but now that I have... I absolutely love it. Very user friendly!",2
Works great for me. But you do have to have good internet or it will disconnect you just like all video conferences apps. Always have updates if yours is not working check if you have a update it.,2
"Zoom used to have a desktop icon where I could open or join the meeting. After the latest upgrade, there is only an extension that sets my own settings, but there's no place to join a meeting in progress, add the meeting or passcode, if necessary. There is no icon on the desktop to open the program and follow the zoom functions of creating a room, joining a room or scheduling a meeting.",1
Excellent,2

September 30th 2021/Pre-Op Class with Lauren Barber and Megan Motter... A GREAT JOB WELL DONE!!! KUDOS!!! To the both of you, Thank You!! and GOD BLESS YOU!!! Sincerely, LESA E KIRBY",2
"The only complaint that I have is the app has overheated my phone, but other than that, I like the app",2
Give me add,2
"Worst experience. Whenever app gets new updated version it stops working... And though we update it, doesn't work.. We have to uninstall and should reinstall. These 3 stars are just for the features to chat, cls, share, etc,..",1
great,2
Very bad app.. Network issues with good running internet though,0
"Works well, nice to be able to step away from my PC and still be connected to the office with Teams on my phone.",2
Log time not shear,0
The app worked fairly well. There was occasional problems with sound quality. I didn't like the idea screen. It was too small. The image of myself was the same size as the other participant so it was only half the screen.,1
Very excellent app. They have changed the design of this app. It's very nice.,2
The app provides a medium to conference and easy to use platform. It provides me the opportunity to see and discuss with friends during this period. I am enjoying using this app. Excellent media platform for live communications.,2
"when im opening the app, it is just a full white screen",0
Works well. Switches easily between phone and computer even mid-meeting for my hectic life/work,2
"After updating and uninstalling it many times screen is not clear, what's the reason for this and how to resolve it?🤔🤔",2
soo poo super awesome 😎 not extremely hot 🔥🥵 not so cold ❄️🥶but so good or bad you comment no sorry hot and cold review good is bad ok.,2
👏👏,2
Good,2
Good but if I open my camera my phone is lagging,1
Good but some times voice problem.,2
"The app is alright. When I try to make meeting it always says ""unable to find meeting, please try again later"". It almost never works and I have to make different accounts to make meeting. Other than that it's awesome!",2
Does not pick the Bluetooth device as default microphone once connected to the phone. Also the options are not clear on the app.,1
The older version is best for chat & message,2
There are some issues and it asks for the password and some things that only happened before apart from the every thing is good👍,0
Consuming data at very high speed. Unable to attend meeting of 1.5 hour with 1.5GB of data,0
Its very easy to use it :),1
This app has destroyed my life by making online class why zoom why did you made this foolish app right now we children's are suffering we are not even understanding a single word from those online classes.😭,0
There are times that gmeet is not working good,1
Video was a bit lagging and voice was cutting off. The Nurse Practitioner had to call me on the phone so we can continue the consultation without interference.,1
Hope they fix this.  It's not as good as it used to be for business. Having many issues since there's no notification when people enter a meeting.,0
It's an interesting app I love it and it's easy to work with,2
"Good platform,at times audio was not clear and breaking",1
5 🌟 ⭐ 🌠 💫 ✡,2
This app development Tamil Nadu school education.,2
Kept cutting out,0
"This is a OK App but I have a issue with sound, Sometime sound goes 0 and comeback after 2 or 3 mins, I can't attend class with this problem Plz fix this",1
On of the Great app and best user experienced.,2
App is so good but class is so boring,0
"Good, but it would be nice if you can go to just the main speaker talking and have yourself in a small screen like zoom.",2
"When I am in a meeting, if I get a phone call it interrupts my meeting audio on my Bluetooth, and rings at full volume. It seems like my meeting is not seen as a phone call so any new calls interrupt it as if it's just a YouTube video. This is incredibly unacceptable as I have to use this for my job, and it causes me to miss people talking, and my ability to talk in crucial meetings.",0
Very Poor Service and they bill their products automatically and charged to us. Very poor quality of customer service.,0
Great use while zoom meetings uses more data but stl.good,2
So bad,2
Very good way of explaining the scheme and its objectives,1
It's nice app.,2
Great. For huge gathering Host should mute everyone. Unmute when they throw a question,2
During the pandemic suitattion it was very helpful for education field,2
When meeting is going on app shows mic and video option on the screen due to which it get touched mistakenly and this makes this app awful.,0
"A good way to talk to friends and family, attend congregation meetings, participate and fellowship with one another,and conduct Bible studies.",2
Great! I appreciate Zoom so much! It allows me to keep in touch with family and friends during these difficult times hard to deal with....thank you Zoom.,2
"I have an ASUS TF300 Android tablet and a Samsung S4 Mini phone and even though they are both two very popular devices, neither are currently supported and unusable.",0
Was very east to connect and video was clear. The audio was a little choppy but all in all a good experience,2
Happy to use this app,2
Great app for work. It just needs a little work on it refreshing statuses forcnew incoming messages or updates showing up. I always have to close and reopen or drag down to refresh after getting an alert something new has come in to read.,2
Good,2
"App so far seems to have all the functionality of the PC app. Quite extraordinary! Weirdly enough, it doesn't work in landscape mode though, which would be useful for viewing documents that are tabbed in Team's Teams.",1
so bed,0
It's really a powerful app. I would give it 5 but most of time when I press on notification to start meeting it doesn't work and I should open the app and press join the meeting button and other times it opens after a while (approx 10 seconds),2
Getting app notifications even after session is expired seems like a slight security oversight. Otherwise does what it's made for.,1
Hi i love this app this review is not a complaint i have a question How to change my video background i updated google meet,2
This app is useful for students but I have a problem . I can't use in this app the virtual background on having Android 11 and the latest version of zoom please fix this bug. After all this app is good.,0
Excellent,2
Very good,2
Dilate,0
Audio over Internet rarely works. Having WebEx call you rarely works. In general the UI just isn't all that friendly.,0
great stuff,2
Good tool for business.,2
حرف نداره,2
Such a worst app,0
"The app was so good, but since updating it continuously glitches on my android and won't open at all. It is stuck on a boot-up loop and fills the whole screen trying to start. Fresh re-install, cache clean and reboot of my phone, and it still won't work. Most frustrating.",0
Very easy to use and you can upload material very easily,1
Very bad,2
I don't like Bec I can even sin up or sin in,0
KENAPA TIDAK BISA DI DOWNLOAD🙏⁉️,0
"I'm not sure about everyone else, but I believe Zoom is the best app to use for a video chatting session to be done. Webex is difficult and Facebook isn't the greatest either. If I have my option to use one of these three, of course it would be Zoom.",2
"Chat not updating, notification received at runtime correctly. But after opening app it not show that recent chat",1
Good for meeting,2
I don't have the features of changing my background I hope you can fix it since my classmate have it on their phone,1
"In mobile there was a feature that, if we minimise the meet a pop up window comes in the bottom of the screen, but after the lastest update the pop up is gone, please bring it back.",0
"in a business meeting, it's very important for us to use a virtual background, why i dont see that option to change the virtual background in my android mobile phone anymore?",1
Much improvement is needed,0
Very data consuming,1
But there's no option to change or hide background during meeting. Is it available only for apple brand?,1
Dor to dor public smart work,0
Looks decent but I cant get it to work on anything. It just circles. I exit and then it makes it to the next step. Each time it's used... Then I tried to connect to trello and it will not let me sign in using the google account I used to set it up. Every app seems to have these issues if you get past the first page in the app.,0
"Limitaram o uso do aplicativo em 45 minutos, atrapalhando quem dava aula por ele. Afinal, lucro importa né? Que se dane as pessoas!",0
Most of the time it's getting disconnected in voice. But good app for teaching. But not working continuously. Breaking up many times. Makes my device get more heat.,1
"It probably would have worked better if I wasn't in the area I am, bad internet reception. Other than that I had no problems with it.",1
Repeated relogin required after recent update.,0
Now the new functions are coming thanks Google meet but the picture quality is not good pls try to solve this problem,2
"This app is fine sound quality good visual quality is good, but I can't see raise hand option in this app??",1
good,2
The audio buffers despite the internet speed being good. Get the basics right before introducing addons,1
رائع,2
Good,2
I am in 9th and I have to keep my attendance proper so our school do class in Teams.... but from last month I am having a glitch that I have admitted in the meeting and I can hear no voice neither I can see any video and after that happens just in 5 mins. I leave meeting on my own please fix this glitch requesting to Microsoft,0

The google meet floating screen is only on keyboard area not on home screen,2
It's very useful l do classes from here and the main thing is it is very organised l really like this l only can cooperate with this app no other apps are suitable to me but stilll there are some prblms l updated it many times but l can't change my front video background.,2
Very bad app,0
Nice app,2
"Constantly losing meetings from my schedule. They just disappear, which means I am constantly checking three other apps to get room details and making sure I don't miss anything. Connection quality is fine, nothing impressive.",0
Lags a little otherwise its fine,1
Excellent. Application has continuously improved making it easier to meet on the go. I was able to access today's meeting while out of the country. Would suggest removing or at least making the speaker's name box smaller. The box covered some content. I tried to move it but it was stationary.,2
I use Gmail as my business email & this app won't accept Gmail as a valid business email . Bit ridiculous.,0
The app has become a lot better since the last time it is working really great. The only problem is that I am not able to open my assignments which are being uploaded it asks to sign in at the black bar and when I click on 'Sign In' it doesn't work. Please fix this. Rest everything is great,1
"The app is good, but I want the old version I like that, more than this version and no audio device in mobile that is the most important and basic thing",1
Go,2

It is a God send for our team.,2
"Great app, dose not exceed Zoom.",2
"This app is a very best app for listening online classes but we want to keep backround,s picture,s in android mobile",1
This app is good although my other classmates can change their background but mine not.,2
Not bad,2
"I'm being charged for this app, it's not under any of my google products. I hate that you get around things like this. I'll have to cancel my Discover Card now since there is no visibility or transparency on how to delete and unsuscribe from a sub-par app only used once.",0
"I had 2 main problems with this app. (Samsung note 8) 1. I couldn't get the microphone to work during video chat 2. In 6 hours, without even open the app, it consumed 21% of my battery. Probably there are some issue with the background management. So sorry, because it seems very useful and easy to use.",0
The meeting was well organised. It was clearly audible.,2
Does not work with BlueTooth headset. I will change the review to 5 stars when this is fixed,0
good,1
"After the recent update, performance is mediocre at best and the 'breakout rooms' feature doesn't appear to work, with a black unending loading screen appearing whenever a user joins a breakout room. This results in the user being stuck in the breakout room, even if the host forces them to close. The only way to leave a meeting when this happens is to close the app itself using the taskbar on my device. Until this issue is fixed, I can't rate more than 3 stars really.",1
Best but .....,2
Audio is not clear.,0
"Refresh / sync not working as it should (used to be). Even if everything was read / hidden /whatever on the computer app still shows unread stuff, chats that were hidenn, ... Problem with media sharing.",0
"The layout is bad, it wont play audio through bluetooth so I turned off my bluetooth and decided to just use my phones speakers. The problem was the app wouldn't pick up me taking. So with bluetooth I could talk but couldn't hear them and without it I could hear them but not speak. Just use zoom or google meets",0
doesnt log out straight away for some reason,0
Waste,0
Google meet is the best way for us in marathi translation,2
Teams is a pretty good app but there are glitches. For example today I had an important practice test and teams app glitched and I couldn't receive any messages due to that I had to rush to finish the test and quickly mail it but thankfully I had my phone from which I could see the test. Pls fix glitches like these. Another problem is that I tried to join and I joined but on the screen it said connecting I could hear everything. It's glitches are very bad pls fix them. It's becoming harder,0
Keeps on asking password,0
It's pretty featureless. Screen share is pretty bandwidth-intensive and probably doesn't use compression.,0
Fuddu app without trial go premium. Can't believe all this.,0
trying the app,2
Best team communication tool of all times. we use it on a large group and it helps you to maintain our team sharpe,2
I'm gae,1
All other things are good except the camera quality! Cameras are very dull and are of poor quality. Also there are some glitches in this app sometimes camera or mike just disappears.,1
This app is ok not very bad not very good,1
I like this aap but no more I have a reason to download it because my class mam say download for our meeting or for some home work I use due for my online classes and meet for meeting or homework and in Google meet my friends have more features look like hand raising and background changer etc. But I don't have that types of features so please give me that types of features,1

Frequently getting disconnected in between,0
Messages read on desktop are still shown as unread in the application. Doesn't update user activity status icon unless you close and open the app again. Android version 11,1
Worst app ever seen,1
This app is very useful it helps me and all my family I can attend my all meetings at home and my children's also attend their online class. But I think you should add a separate chatroom for members in meeting it should help us to whisper some confidential and personal information.,1
"The recent update has made the app suck.   You're greeted with a sloppy webpage when you open the app, can't go straight to the chat  UI elements and transitions suck. Have to mandatorily log in, app doesn't handle appear.in/room-name link which opens in browser instead.   Bad move switching it from native to hybrid app, it doesn't suit this app. Please make it better than before and I'll give it 5 stars again. Its so good, please don't make it sucky.",0
It was good as audio was clear,2
Hey it's actually good but it's hanging too much and I always update this app but am not able to change the background or am neither being able to use the raise my hand option actually I'm not getting those options Please do something of this problem as soon as possible,1

Google can you make the next update to everyone using G meet can have the background effect you know I am just 11 yrs old so the last review was to complicated for me,2
The app is terribly slow. It's just unacceptable. I expected far better from Microsoft. this app is nowhere near Microsoft experience.,0
This is the second time in two weeks I have Not been able to get on a Zoom presentation. Others on mobile phones seem to be saying they are also having problems.,0
I dont understand how to use,2
After the recent update I can no longer view other users in multi Windows during meetings. That was the beauty of using Zoom. Why is this feature not available now?,0
not even logging in with google,0
"Excellent  Clarity and works perfectly without dropping calls in St Thomas, US Virgin Islands",2

My problem is I hope you put a hand logo wherein if you press it your teacher will notice you immediately. Thank you,1
Excellent. Like the ability to share applications. Quality and almost instant response are key elements the product supplies,2
Meeting partcipants were not audible. I could see one participant on scteen. To much attention to sending info. Time was wasted on mechanics. First time using Webex on android.,1
Internet highly used,1
The join meeting link doesn't work. Web help to join meeting is not timely. Phone app behaves differently fromm the computer app.,0
Great way to get updates on all your team,2
Sometimes host sounded muffled and skipping and/or lagging.,1
Not intuitive couldn't change name once in meeting,1
So good,2
For the most part is was a good experience. Had a few moments where the audio was lost.,2
Excellent,2
"Need a tutorial on how to use and button knowledge. I got frustrated because new to me. I think there may have been one when first signed on once before, but it has been a while since then.",1

Easy navigation and very crystal clear audio.,2

Very good functionality. It'd be better to be able to see more cameras and have the cameras be able to be selected by me as a user or at least the selection algorithm be based more on speaking time over the course of the meeting,2

My experience with the latest version is failures and restarts if I fold my device open or unfold it during a meeting I get booted for my meetings. It looks like there's an attempt to reconnect but it's frustrating especially for meetings where an administrator has to admit me. I'm using the Galaxy z flip 3 and I'm on Android 12.,0

Please dont waste time with this app. I have full speed internet connection then also the video and audio is not clear,0
All okay but the profile photo doesn't change in the meeting and it takes very long to update. Fix this issue!,1
Idk yet,0
I'm finding that this app is nolonger updating when new conversations occur. It's a shame as we use it as a form of communication for work yet we find that we have to revert back to sending emails or WhatsApp messages to get in touch as the app fails to notify users of new messages.,0
"I don't need to get a notification every time I get a message when using teams from another device! I'm clearly using Teams on my computer, having a conversation, and my phone is bleeping away like a maniac. This has never been an issue before.",0
"Incredibly buggy, drops calls CONSTANTLY.",0
Update version is nice 👍🤠,2
Good,2
Great until it asks me for sign in usually multiple times a day and usually when a call comes in making it impossible to take the TEAMS call. Very frustrating. I want to sign in and stay signed in.,1
The app is so laggy when I get in it start on the loading screen,0
Very well organised and staff follows the requirements of safe management in place. Not to mention the given out free freebies v generous. Love it so much!! 😘. Thanks ttsh kampong family for thier hard work. 🙏 😊,2
Worst experience,0
Super app It was were super app Fast update super app and share invite link and app link to Download app link and super fast join super app,2
Can't get this app to stop pending the downloading part to even get a chance to use it,1
Good app for official meetings...,2
It is not downloading on laptop,0
Great 👍,2
"Great app, I enjoyed it as a student 👌",2
"Blessed Day, please allow all phone users, especially Android users, to use a virtual background because I cannot focus on the discussion because my background is messy. Thank you so much, and God bless. Please consider my suggestion if it is alright.",0
"Constantly eats up data and always shows up blank. Doesn't show anything at all on my screen. What I mean is when I select things, like to check on my things I stare at a blank loading screen for hours. This happened ever since I got a new phone that's more modern. My two other phones I had the app worked just fine. Except it slowed my phone. For me this is slightly below average because me and many other people experience problems constantly. This app is pretty necessary so please fix it.",0
"whenever I join meeting the app always expels me out for no reason, my network connectivity is also good...I reported this concern to you but no action took place",0
The Network is not very stable thus sometimes resulting in loosing some vital part of the meeting.,1
"Nice app and very much convenient for online meetings but im having this issue that my profile piture is not changing at all. I had kept a profile pic but now when im trying to change it, its not being changed.",1
"Can't join the meetings, app is lagging a lot",0
Nice except for the audio,2
Connectivity issues and bugs are ruling this app but it is a pretty useful one,1
"I really liked it! I don't know what happened, but during our meeting, the app abruptly closes without prior notice, then I had to reopen it again. I'm not sure if it has something to do with my internet connection or the app itself or my phone",2
Excellent app when PC not around and need to attend a project meeting thanks MS office...,2
Dude I have a problem about network connection goofs dismiss I rlly tried to connect in the video call but it doesn't work it forever says dismiss I tried to join but it doesn't work at all please fix that dismiss technical goofs,0
"Every single feature - audio, video, screen share and chat, what i have tried are flawless simultaneously. Very simple to use user friendly too!!",2
It barely has any problem when a meeting is going on and it is compatible with very old devices,2
There's no feature for ANDROID to change your background which is a hassle. You need to use a lappy to change your background and back to your phone.,0
My google meet can't updated and not provide good service plz check,0

"I liked that anyone can present the screen. No matter who the host is. Just one thing that it should be on the user, whom to pin and whom not.",1
Good,0
Poor,0
It's a conference app that won't let me talk. Others can't hear me. Unless I unlock my phone. Somehow that unlocks the app. Even though I already started it and joined the conference. Totally unusable!!,0
"Consumes a huge amount of internet, only ⅓ of the meeting we can attend.",1
"Work on the app, it's horrible.",0

Always crashes...please update,0
My experience is greater . This is really best app. The advantage that I mostly like is that we can do our online classes for a long time .,2
Nice,2
"Works well most of the time. Sometimes refused to use the Bluetooth headset for calls/meetings, and I have no hang up and try again.",1
I am still trying to see how I can use it and how optimal it is. So far so good,1
"WebEx is easy and convenient! However, I do experience many audio issues, during WebEx meetings that sometimes drop my connection.",2
Add clapping sounds along with clapping emojis.,2
"Webex is improving. MS Teams is still my tool of choice, but too expensive.",1
Sound kept going off and it was hard to hear the instructor and others. It also didn't let you see others and talk with them.,1
Very simple operating system Very useful Conectivity,2
Needs to build in FB features we're used to,2
Ok so...I have been using this app for like 6 months now and when I first started there was a differnt layout which was white and I kinda like that layout so I think that there should be an option where you can choose which layout you want cuz I have seen some more people who want the old layout back otherwise the app is good,2
Good,2
Not sure,0
Audio voice is too low,0
This app was beautiful and nice boss.,2
"My ViVo V20 pro cannot share any contents during a meeting. (Update: This is resolved in Nov 2021, Thank you very much)",1

Good only,1
Terrible experience. Could not unmute my microphone. Connection was subpar. Audio not great.,0
"It's still better but I wanted that the group host should get that, some people left the so that they shouldn't left so please a feature on it.",1
The app is good but one problem was that when I turn on the unmute button for speaking it was taking so much mobile data,1
"Easy to use, multiple tools. Ability to hold meetings, do presentations and collaborate easily with colleagues.",2
It was good got through the meeting just fine,2
"For some unknown reasons after the last update the files i want to open that are assigned to me dont open, when i try clicking on it, it shows the loading icon to the left but it doesnt open. Hopefully you fix this issue soon.",0
User friendly and quick. Video and sound quality are also good,2

"My doughters school is using this for online teaching. The issue she facing is she never gets unmuted by teacher. When teacher says she is unmuted everyone, we can hear other children speaking, all the noice, but she cant participate cause she doesn't get unmuted. When we press the unmute button, it keeps showing ""muted by organiser"", even though we can see other childrens voices. We have tried this app on diffrent android deviced and experienced the same. Not sure where the problem is!!",0
Its really good but I would like if they add filters,2
Good,1
It's very good app,2
Nice,1
"Not able to attend the class after updating the app ""It says we couldn't complete the call"" Please fix the issue",0
"Works reasonably well, especially at draining battery on video calls. Also switching networks always results in about 15 seconds worth of lost audio. It also needs better handing to see more participants on video calls. Four per page appears hard coded.",1
Slow in muting unmuting calls,1
"We use it a lot at work, especially when working from home or to have meetings with clients and I really love it.",2
"The apps great and all, but i keep disconnecting every 5-10 mins during my class session, My internet was not part of the problem since i have a stable connection.",1

This is very good app to connect with employees working in your organisation across the location. I have a delightful experience.,2
Too many network problems with this app. Here there is full network. Then how? Plz resolve this problem. Other all it's best.,1
Good android app but desktop windows ver. not Available ?,1
Continuously error comes only 1 problem otherwise it's good,2
Audio quality was fair but generally muffled. Connectivity lost during meeting.,1
I like it very much,2
I have to give it one star cause the new update is bad. Everytime I open an app the zoom lags and then my laptop crashed cause it can't handle the lag. Remove the opening app lag. (Zoom suck),0
Nice app 👌👌👍👍,1
This app never launch on phone,1
"GoToMeeting is a polished, stable meeting platform that ""just works"". The problem is that it lacks basic features that literally every single other meeting platform provides... most notably, being able to paste in screenshots, attach files to a chat, etc. Without even that rudimentary functionality, GTM is a dinosaur. I work for Citrix (who ironically used to own GTM), so we still use GTM a lot... however, we are in the process of moving to Teams. It's sad, but GTM just can't keep up. :(",1

Audio was very bad. We are unabl e to hear others speaking.,2
This application is not changing back ground i am deleting the app,0
Unintuitive app. Too many unnecessary security features that makes it an inconvenient tool for collaboration when compared to competitors products.,0
Needs an option to delete message while meeting is ongoing,1

I normally could have a 12 people or more on the conference call now it's only 7 people can get on?,1
Get disconnected when connected to bluetooth speaker.,0
1) Pls make tile up to 25 people (2) please do update the host controls such as disable microphone and video for everyone (3) Add Activities such as Jamboard. (4) Add Co-Hosts for free users too(nice if you add). (5) Add Raise Hand feature ( it's must needed even for free users) (6) Add lighting effect for camera. Pls add these features! It's must!!,1
Im sorry.,0

"I attended a webinar which was organised by a college of Delhi University in Delhi, India. All the attendees of the event were present in India. But my Telecom operator charged me a heavy amount for attending that webinar. I asked few other attendees, but they were not charged. Could it be chargeable? (My call log is showing that I dialled some number through GotoMeeting app)",0
Sound quality was poor,0
"It is better but i like to some facility which is provide in older version such as a there is no disturbance of which people is join or remove while teaching , chat is side by side to pesent screen for faster communication , there is a symbol of user in presented screen is very small in older version but larger in new version and between screen .",1
It's fine and all but there is no feature for screen sharing a video with its audio. It disappoints me that I need to really use laptop or pc just to be able to share screen with audio rather than using my phone or tablet. I do hope they add such feature later on,0
Within 60 seconds I downloaded the app and was speaking with a friend live with an amazingly clear picture! Very impressive,2
Works beautifully every time I need it. It's my primary communication tool for work and it has yet to fail me over a year in...,2
Can't get into the meetings for some reason,0
I like it,2
The connection was very stable and the audio was decent. 👂👍,2
"WARNING - CARE FOR HEARING DAMAGE There is no dial tone for a teams call. If you're using the ear piece and they don't pick up, the ""user is not able to pick up"" response will blast on the earpiece and make your ear ring.",0

Zoom online classes is very popular & different zoom learning is very simple,0
"Before the update available dated 11-29-21 ( which I only saw available as I came to leave this review) Zoom has made my weekly therapy and monthly PCP appointments a breeze I don't have to drive anywhere I just have to log in 10 minutes before my appointment time and the app does the rest! The only problems that have arisen for me using zoom over the last 2 years were all user error whether I was the user or the professionals on the other end were considered the users, all is good now",2

"The UI is clunky and unintuitive. Chat is hidden behind 2-3 taps depending on how you access it. Picture-in-picture doesn't work correctly. It's either way too big, or compressed and the buttons don't work. It switches off. The video quality is pretty good though, as is the tooling. MS Teams is far better though.",0
Really like teams. Big feature request. Vim in message box (I know for the desktop app). The markdown features are superb though. SharePoint integration is a little messy. That might be more of an issue with SharePoint.,2
"The mobile version is unreliable. The video sharing option frequently doesn't work and I have to restart my phone to get it to work. When I click the vido share button, the icon spins indefinitely. I also noticed that the audio is choppy since my Android device was updated. The desktop version is more reliable.",0

Hard to log out from previous meetings,0
"Overall, I like it... But, the fact that I have to sign in and confirm via text -every- time I use the app... But it still asks, ""do you want to log in with finger print?"" But it never remembers... So, -2 stars... I've tried reinstall, cache clear, phone reset... Nothing fixed it...",1

"Micro teams service, video & audio was broken up & cut in & out, repeatedly. From each end of the call. It wasn't that 1 person may of had poor service. The app itself is a poor serviced app. I'd recommend Zoom, FIRST & FOREMOST. Zoom has been ""MY PERSONAL BEST EXPERIENCE"". I've used micro teams, Telemedicine, duo, ZOOM, etc. Micro teams was the worst quality out of any video/audio app I've used. For Dr. Appt, counseling, therapy, rehab meetings, court, video meetings w/ government workers.",0

"1. App keeps crashing on Android, even after reinstalling.   2. The platform does not offer any task/project management related features as other work-related apps (eg: Trello, slack) do.  3. Does not offer calendar integration, file sharing/collaboration, meeting/webinar integration etc. Some sort of integration with other platforms, such as, google calendar, GDoc, Dropbox, GoToMeeting, WebEx would have been useful features that could potentially set Workplace apart.  4. Having the option to open discussion Groups including users from other organisations seem an useful feature helping cross-organisational collaboration. Similarly, ability to publish or cross-post from inside Workplace to other external platforms (for some chosen items) would have been a useful feature, saving hours of staff and team-coordination time. Eg, publishing an Event as a public post or to an FB page directly (via integration), twitting in the same manner. This way 'under-the-hood' team/task management inside Workplace could instantly translate into actions outside the platform, without having to spend/invest (distractingly, if I may add) too much staff-time in those external platforms.  As a 'paid' service Workplace should consider implementing some of these work-related features, paying close attention to work related needs. As a starting point, please open a 'feature request' tab/link somewhere, to be overseen by an attentive/engaging CS team, even if they engage with SysAdmins only.  Thanks.",0
I have updated but it's telling to update but when I clike to update or dissmis it shows update but not working,0

Best of all, all the people I want to talk to are available via this app. I use this app more than my phone anymore, and that's saying something.",2

PC previous version was far better than recent updates because previously all recent chats were showed at the top which is so easy...

I'm in the IT department for my company and was looking forward to testing this software.  However after installing the app I was greeted with a message that my device is not supported.  This baffles me since I am running lollipop and my android device is only 1 year old.  Needless to say I already deleted the app and determined it will not work for our company.,0

Cool App!,2
I have used uberconference for years and it has always performed exceptionally well. It is a great tool! Love the free recording and its tie to temi for transcripts. Amazingly good products and services for a great price!,2
It was very good to use and clearly with video.,0
Very bab,0
"I can't say enough good things about UberConference. The Android app in particular is very well designed and engineered. The user interface is an absolute top feature, so it inspires you to use it. I also like that new features are always being added. Keep it up guys!",2

Excellent app. You have said that zoom uses 3g 4g and 5g data. My is 4g but whenever I use my mobile data I disconnect. Why? Please check,1
"Can't add background using the application in phone. It's really important that you add this feature because privacy matters. Additionally, it consumes so much data usage unlike other platforms.",0
Ok,2
One of if not the best conferencing tools I have used.,2
Okay,1
This is a amazing app for video chatting but you have to remove the 40 minutes free meeting rule that's annoying I just hate this 40 minutes rule but other than that this goo,1
It was helpful and informative about all levels of childrens needs and why some behavior and removals occur.,2
Great app,2
cant use,0
Great app,2
Lot of interruption with not being able to hear on my end or be able to keep the website up and running.,1
So quite and very good app,2
I am giving 3 star because it is hard to keep backround in mobile and blur background but in googlmeet we can keep blur and other backround and add backround in gallery pls solve this problem if you solve this problem I will give 5 star and I am having lot of network issue in zoom but in Google meet I had no issue pls pls pls solve this problem if you didn't solve this problem I will give 1 star for this .,1
Whenever there is a call recieved by me then I left the meet and I need to rejoin it again so please add automatic hold option for calls in the Google meet.,1
"I cannot maintain the sound with zoom I cannot get the sound to hear or speak the sound gives me problems , sorry about that",0
"It is really amazing app, all the lectures are arranged on a calendar very perfectly, it is very easy to use this app. All the assignments can be sent in assignments section. Also , the video calls doesn't consume more data.I think it's a best app for students and also for teachers",2
"Earlier version was much better and easy to use , was very convenient This version is very annoying",1
Ok not so good but yea ok ok,1
Very Impressive :),1
"It's a great app. I would like to beg for a background feature on mobile phones because we really need it, it's one of our requirements in our class. Mobile user students usually gets behind and it's very unfair for us who cannot posses desktop devices.",1
"Universal webcam app. No need to sign up for you or your friend. Create name of chat room and that will become the url. Invite your friend to join you through sms, messenger, fb + more, all they need to do is click the link and you will instantly be connected. You can choose to hide video and/ or mute sound and you can just chat by typing. It's the best!",2
"On the S21, the keyboard almost always blocks the text entry field, making it impossible to 'send' text by clocking the arrow button. Same issue with Gboard and Swiftkey",1
Not connected for meeting,0
"This app is terrible, it's constantly cutting off what I'm trying to type and refreshing I cannot even type a full word most times. It is also very slow at updating when messages are sent or received, this is true when connected to Wi-Fi or cell",0
"This is a superb app..... But some time's it show's error code, that's the only problem of this app! So please fix it.",2
Easy to use conference calling features. Great for small team calls. More callers and features require a monthly subscription which is a much cheaper than Gotomeeting.,2
Many problems,0
1. No option edit meeting layout. Current layout is not user friendly 2. No option to annotate on shared screen 3. Switching between private chat and public chat is hectic. It should be controlled via simple @ symbol 4. Meeting takes lot of time to launch when URL is used. Many times it fails as well 5. Current speaker window should be overlayed on shared screen. Lot of screen is wasted in current layout making it difficult to see in small screens,0
Trying to install but not installing after so many times,0
Pretty good way to widen the geographic boundaries of the meeting space.,2
I can't upload a profile photo.... I use a tablet and an android phone.... So how do I upload an image...,0
I am using this app since past 2 yrs.This app is nice but the reason why I give it two stars is so much network error i got left from meeting automatically. You should make our profile photo bigger in that square. The photo is smaller even there is space in that square. So make our profile photo bigger in meeting. Other functions are good. 😊😊😊,1
Was unable to find the Apps in the store for my new phone.,2
This app doesn't provide much service for mobile users Please please 🙏 add features of video quality control for mobile users too. My phone gets heated like a oven while turning video on for 30 minutes Also I suggest you to add features like virtual background in mobile too,0
But in the DOWNLOAD :-:-$,1
"The app is okay, but sometimes you can not hear the other person",1
Aa I liked it,2
"Enjoyed the presentation to a degree. Technically we received a fairly poor transmission, as the audio and video jittered a lot. Many thanks though.",1

It's kinda not good,0
Love the app the best meeting appp!! But the reason I gave 3 stars is because I can't put virtual backgrounds in my Lenovo Tab M10 it was really irritating because it happens with most of the android devices but in another samsung phone it works but not on the other devices I have the latest version too but doesn't work so fix this then 5 stars,1
"Extremely bad.... Full of hackers... I am from grade 6 our class is always getting disturbed... Hackers are coming and using extreme slangs, scolding us and teacher and even renaming themselves as us.. Fix this or it will be a serious issue.",0

I used to find this application useful but recently I've been facing constant problems while joining my meetings. I suddenly get disconnected from my meetings and it takes a lot of time to load a meeting and I eventually am unable to connect. I don't think it is a problem with my internet connection as I've been doing the rest of my classes in Microsoft teams and using other services perfectly without any interruption in the same device with the same wifi.,0
Brilliant video conference app! Best out there!,2
it is still not working it is very good app but for the background it is very worst for this only .,0

"Need a lot of resources when using it in along period, makes phone/laptop so hot.. When using hp, can't use virtual background",1
Reasonable intuitive but because I could not be verified by gmail I could not speak and say something critical. All I could do was eave and not wave and some on said not waving drowning and they were right. If you know the rules of the sea then just to stick your hand up indicates distress.,2

Why is sharing screen while having the camera on are not a feature?.. sometimes students need to do a presentation with power point and face cam turn on. The fact that it is not a feature yet is a burden and a frustration smh,1

The app itself is acceptable for what it is used for in my company. However the quality of sound is something that needs to be improved. Way too many times people speaking or interrupted by static or simply cut off. If This Were to be fit I would change my rating to a five,1

"Although it works to what is proposes to do, it does so poorly. - Audio mutes itself if app is sent to the background (another app opened) - Audio output selection is buggy (selecting bluetooth sometimes enables speaker, selecting speaker enables earpiece, etc...) - HUGE and I mean HUGE power and CPU usage. To the point of draining my battery and when I connected my charger the phone wouldn't charge because its temperature was too high. Had to put the phone on the car vents to cool it off (then it started charging again) - and only Webex was running - not other app. - Same power consumption is seen in PC (open task manager and it uses around 6% of my i7-9700 and ""power usage"" always reads ""HIGH"" - corroborating the same power hungriness of my cellphone.",0

"Well let me start by saying this, when I first started using this app and I was in a conference call meeting more than once I got kicked out of the meeting and I use this app twice a week for my meetings so twice a week is quite a bit considering that you need this app for your business purposes or social purposes. But I've noticed the last month or so that it has gotten better. The only problem I have now is that when you're in a meeting it keeps making a noise I would not know how to explain .",2

The toolbar functionality in desktop is awkward to open and close to remove it from your view. 3.

Good app for call and classes but sometimes it does show other members and just say that you are the only in meeting even if network is fast. And sometimes it take too long in setting up and ask to join button comes late...more over it sometimes leave the class automatically. Besides this it's quite ok...but they should work in these concerns too.,1
Love it!! Great quality. I have used a few times and have never had an issue. Awesome features! Hope it stays free.,2
This is very good app but the problem is that I can't use the virtual background in meet. So plz set the virtual background also supported the android phones,2

This app is nice But there is no option of filter Please add this option then I will rate 5 stars,1
This is the best simple yet effective video conferencing solution ever used!,2
Nice option,1

Its junk wont load on my phone,0
Google meet was a good app but the reason I give u 3 star it's because last night I saw that mobile can add background and my phone already updated it automatic and I thought this morning i could change background because I have class today I wanna open my camera but with different background but they nothing change add background on mobile then I give u 5 star,2
Now I use this a lot and it's good now. My only problem is that I can't access the backgrounds in call.,1
It's nice app but sometimes it take more time to load please improve its load performance.,2
"Poor connection, frequent drops, constant updates that improve nothing",0
It's yery best app for online class and me and my friends to talk and study with each other. but it is always telling for rating i had rated one time then also it is telling rate us,0
The corotana feature is not working properly. When I ask it to join my next class it does not join the next class. I would really appreciate if Microsoft will look into this matter. My regards,1
Audio and video quality is poor. Please try to improve,1
Please reduce the data usage in Google meet it takes so much data please reduce it although app has many other problems.,0
The initial set up was easy for Me because I was led thru it step by step. It is like any other app You set up. Follow the information Your told to do and You will be up and running in a few minutes. 😉 Enjoy Pat!,2
It helped to continue our classes on online. I am thankful💕 but the video quality is poor. Everything else is good👍,1
Back ground wallpaper not working,2
voice is not audible from another side person,1
I love the redesigned UI!  Super simple and easy to use.  No PIN on my conference line makes it a snap for others to call in.,2
Good,1
"Good app. Concern, how can one application update be 140MB and there are other apps needing update versus a memory of 31 of 32GB. Over time, these updates have taken up most of memory space. Eventually, the phone won't run cutest of unending huge updates. Could we have reasonable update sizes, not everyone has huge capacity phones?",2
This is a very difficult app to manage on a handheld device. It also does not automatically shut down and will kill the battery!! Fail!,0
"Ideally there should be a setting to have the camera and or mic default to off when logging into the room.  Too many times you get caught off guard and it's like ""woah, that wasn't what I wanted"".",1
Buggy and full of issues. Camera randomly dies despite 5G internet. Zoom has no problems. Better use Zoom and compel your company to use the same.,0
Good,1
It was a nice experience.,2
disconnects from server unexpectly anytime and really often. After 1/2 hour or something like that. Not usable at all because of that as it requires to login again.,0
While I am able do conference from mobile app. I am not able to share screen from mobile or tablet,1
Voice not clear,1
"Replaces Hangouts, but requires you open a link sent by some messenger service. Hangouts was the messenger service. So what was a 1 step process is a 2+ step process. Thanks a lot",0
It's a conference app that won't let me talk. Others can't hear me. Unless I unlock my phone. Somehow that unlocks the app. Even though I already started it and joined the conference. Totally unusable!!,0
Made my tablet crash like 3 times and gives off a lot of lag and it gliches a lot,0
Showing couldn't connect to the meeting 😅,1
Good,2
Auto back.,0
It is very good but it's can can be like the another person is there if there video we can take here and there like a cube then it will is awesome 😎😎 so do it,2
Upset with the app I uninstalled. Cant see one feature which excited me. To take a class through video calling is very annoying because you cant control the video calls voice you cant mute or unmute. You will not have the advantage of being host to take control of the class room video call session,0
My audio went way low and I could barely hear anyone speaking.,0

It's just awful,0
The content Cutts in and out,1

"Well it asks to unmute if there is even a small noice, which is pretty annoying as jn most cases you dont want to unmute youself, everything else is ok and there should also be some improvement over the way the layout is represented, its ok in pc bit in mobile its not up to the mark.",1

Worst App ever seenI don't like this app worst app ever not even for 0 stars many glitches can't get requirements of virtual background very worst app this app is worst than zoom is the best this app when it hang's up i can't even shutdown my laptop👨‍💻💻👩‍💻 worst app,0
1st time user. Relatively easy to navigate. Spell check would be useful,2
Got disconnected from a call and no longer able to call back due to all call buttons being inactive. Terrible experience,0
"Reliable, so easy to use.",2
"Have to force close the app and refresh the feed in order to see new messages in the active chat. Images take forever to load even though internet speeds are fantastic where I am.

I don't like this 😽🤧,0
So reliable and data efficient,2

"I'd give it negative 🌟s if I could. Single handedly the most useless POS I have to contend with on a weekly basis. Doesn't like my phone, computer, tablet, WiFi, internet, ANYTHING! (Samsung/Optus) Every week I NEED to use it to confirm/accept shifts for my job. So I usually get to spend an absolutely awesome 45 to well over an hour just sitting there refreshing/reopening it until it magically decides to bloody work! It's been over 6 months. Service hasn't improved. Your product sucks.",0
teams don't have blur background option for Androids and chat box is invisible in mobile phones,1
Nice aap,2
Nice,0
"The app's great in things but audio issues, video issues, and ofc the APP ISSUES. Audio issues are normal like we can't hear the person who's speaking or there voice comes like with a robotic voice… Video issues are okish even tho the person has good network it is blur video sometimes… but I appreciate how they have a virtual background! It's very helpful. And now the APP ISSUES. It's difficult to sign in for making your own meeting! There's might be more but I don't remember them but install!",1
Mostly good but lack of option to tile video calls knocks it down from 4.5* to 3.5*,1
I love this app it's good I can easily join and chat but the only problem is that all my chat is recorded. I want my chat to be secure. So it's a request to work on this.🙂,2
Very good app for class and meeting,2
Want let me get get to it,2
Ang tagal nyang idownload putek HAHAHAHAH peroo no choice kelangan q sya sa online class q HAHAHA,1
Clear audio. Easy connections and adjustments. Best video session I've been involved with so far.,2
It's amazing . But It should have an option to change background on android also,2
خوبه,1
This is a very good app I have ever used. But the main problem in it is when my meeting is going on and while doing online test on Google so if anyone in the meeting or even I suffer a problem that from mobile or tablet when we open another app our video gets closed so please make some efforts in that so that our video can be on while opening another app also please......,2
"Always clear, with great audio and visual. Easy to use.",2
This app is very nice👍👍,2
"Google meet is an excellent app. But, sometimes I see that that the audio and video is cracking a bit. Also, I think some meetings will become better meetings if filters were added. And if I join a meeting from this phone, quite often I see that it says ""google meet has stopped"".",2
wonderful experience to interact,2
"I like it, it helps to keep track of the hours you put into youronline busi",2
Background effects should be added in Android mobiles,2
Audio is disconnected frequently and my device is heating up whenever l use webex,1
Thank you for zoom. It is the audio that was not working well.,1
Buatiful app,2
Nice,2
Nice app,2
No chippy,1
"I use this app for my school but my problems are that I can't even change my profile picture and that's very annoying, and also I don't even get notifications,calls,and texts. And when I'm afk my teacher usually call me when I'm not in the class and I'm afk, I don't even get my teachers calls and my classmates calls and I'm trying to make the calls notification on but it doesn't work so please fix that.",1
Nope trash,0
Cluttered interface. Lacks attachments sharing option,1
"I use this app for work... it is so nice to keep up with everything even on my days off! Plus, I am still able to keep in contact with people at work when I am not at a desktop! The only issue I have is sometimes the messages don't always come through right away... sometimes it takes 10 min up to 30 min at times but that only happens once in a great while!",2

"Phones temperature is Raising, just few tries before it asks for premium, screen mirror stops working if it's running in the background.",0
Nice,0
Thanks,2
This is bad,0
"As others say: app is just a wrapper around a web page (which isn't even made for the app, the FAQs aren't relevant, at least one link is broken), you can't join a room that exists only create a room - so 2 people with the app can't communicate. Use the website. It might not be the worst ""app"" ever but it's got to be a contender.",0
Its wonderful. Clear audio and visuals. Also quite easy to use,2
"It's not a quick user friendly app, there should be user ID available and not email addresses for invitations. This is time consuming.",1
"Not working, after sign up I am trying to log in but its every time show me incorrect I'd or password.",0
No sound,0
"It's fine in use generally but after logging out, it isn't letting me create a new account for the use of my new school. It keeps showing the sign that says ""the organization needs more info"" And keeps asking to input the user name and password repeatedly after saying there was an issue and to try later. I tried to report the issue but I don't think it's working either. Requested to fix this but still hasn't been fixed yet.",0
"Difficult to hear sometimes, presentation got hung up and we had to recreate a new meeting. Format was nice though.",1
"Use this app to join WebEx meetings. There's 2 WebEx apps and the descriptions are generic, but this is the one you want if you have a meeting code and password to join a video meeting. The app works well on 4G data. If your sound goes out, turn the speaker off then on to fix it.",2
"Crashes everytime I open the app. Tried clearing cache, uninstalled and reinstalled, same issue everytime. You would think this is one app that Microsoft would fix pretty quickly!",0
"The latest version do not have raise hand option and to change background. I've updated the app and my mobile too, Pls have a change in it. Pls Add raise hand option and change background option too.",2
App very slow,1
It's alright but my only problem is that if I call someone it glitches a lot so Microsoft please fix that and thanks for reading my review on teams,1
Video Quality not Good in Samsung S20 FE 5G. But normal photo is very good. Only problem in zoom Video Meeting.,0
"I like the fact I can search and send a message to anyone in our agency, and I can see if they are online or busy.",2
It is a nice app for video conferencing. It doesn't have any time interruption which makes it more prefferable than other applications. One bad side of the app is my own profile stays on screen which makes some problem while watching someone's screen. Same happens while using on a browser on desktop.,1
good,2
good app,2
Repeatedly voice breaking,1
Logo shortcut does not showing,0

can google meet have a private chat like you can choose who to send a message to that only that person can see??,2
Loved this first time great service,2
The app won't install. It's goes to 100% then back to 1% and then stops.,0
The webinar audio is not automatically muted when there is a phone call.,0
Good mobile implementation of webex. The app is intuitive to use and provides all the necessary features,2
Great for conference calls with larger numbers and it becomes easier to navigate with time even for those of us with technical difficulty whom are prone to operator errors. Lol,2
I am not able to change the background and not able to use the filter option it is not showing the option . I complained about it but still they have not corrected it .,0
I have a error to join the meeting.The error code was 104103,1
Great service and app! Great quality!,2
"Hate the auto rotate on meeting. Is there any option to turn it off? It just literally rotate every time I over tilt the phone, unless you are on split screen. Just make this feature customable!",1

The picture was clear & and all but I could barely hear in my meeting even with turning my volume all the way up.,1
It is very good app because when now I updated it was working wonderful :) but one problem is there we can't take screenshot :( so I give 4 stars:(.,2
Nice,0
The only problem I have with google meet is that I can't screen record our class (as a student). I really need to screen record so that I can rewatch our lessons again. And I also need to screen record because some of our teachers doesn't post their materials in our g classroom. I don't know if the problem is the app itself or our school did something to prohibit us from screen recording.,2
Have this on my mobile because of company policy. It appears to be a memory hog and battery drain.,1
My reasons to give only 3 star I have some complaint there is not a background in mobile for the mobile users get problem in online classes so please improve this ok,1
"You guys have got to give more options in the setting option, there's literally nothing, also video lags too much ehen screen shared and also audio is not working in phone, when trying to play a song or anything that contains an audio.",0

I hateee itt pls dont be always update :/ Ughh:<<<,0
No work,0
Nice app but the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars because it consumes a lot of data in one meeting. It consumes upto 500mb or so in just 45 to 60 minutes. Although it is easy to use but consumes a lot of data. Please fix this by providing some options such as to choose the quality of the video call in the meeting. Thanking you,0
Too much audio problems after update plz resolve it i am a student and i am studying on it and audio disconnects everytime for some reason Plz resolve it,1

Here i want to bring this to your notice that in our school many of our students are facing problem in opening assignment after the new update. Pdf files cannot be opened in while usung the app and the teams is also not supported in the google chrome and hence there is another issue that the google chrome in also not getting updated. So kindly give us a solution.,1

Screen layout seem not optimized if using tablet. So 3 star from me. Google developer should focus as well apps in tablet market.,1
It is a very good app for meeting but it closes unexpectedly and leaves my meeting and it always show bad network quality and it opened after 30 min and when it openes it lags and it get good and when i join the meeting it again hangs and show bad network quality but I Am having a great wi-fi. The voice comes very low sometimes and when this is OK then the voice cuts a lot. And it never works with my Bluetooth lead of boat rockers and leaves my meeting and when u close it is dose not even close.,0

Its was easy to access the meeting and operate how to log on etc the sound quality was good and you are given the option for visual or audio when in the meeting l just wish l hadnt list connection to the meeting it might have been my reception or the app itself,1
Audio is very worst I have never seen it yet once the meeting will be on audio switch on and off automatically so show some effort on it,0
I do a weekly meeting through Microsoft Teams and I have never had any problems in the past 6 months,2

Poor performance. No multi camera support makes it barely useable. Meetings tend to take place across various platforms and therefore all participants need to have the same interface regardless of the OS they're using. Certainly not worth paying for at the moment.,0

Extremely heavy app. Makes everything else on my phone slow. I have an android and before teams was working in excellent condition. Teams is excruciatingly slow for each click you have to wait for like 20 secs for screen to load. All my other apps hang. If i could I'd uninstall but must use for office.

It's very useful but the audio ia always delayed. Hopefully you guys will be able to improve on this.,1
"App is mostly well done. There are a couple issues that I have experienced from day one like notifications being totally unreliable, chats not always refreshing even when doing a manual pull, and random chat conversations not syncing with read/unread messages. The notifications one is the biggest complaint since I rely on this for work and can easily miss messages directed at me. Still giving it 4 stars since those are the only issues and rest of the app works very well.",2
GoTo works really well on Android. The worst app by far is Web Ex. I despise WebEx on Apple and Android. Microsoft teams is maybe second best. Zoom is ok as well. Two thumbs up for GoTo!,2
After updating to the latest version I cannot open any pdf or Onenote link from within Teams. Please fix this issue.,1
Organizer could not broadcast video,2
Can't understand other person very well.,1

The app is great but I observed nowadays there is a glitch only with androids that the assignments are not opening. I request to fix it ASAP..,2
I like the voice to text it seems to be more accurate than just your regular text. I do like that you can toggle between available meeting etc & pictures seem to go through well.,2

All working fine. Only thing I found is that the unread messages indication does not automatically disappear when I read the messages on my computer.,2

Bcz there's no option about recording sometimes the app is stuks and the dark colour automatically changing and if I mute the chat and I called to my friend and I talked but the notification sound is coming and sometimes it's not showing the meeting link in calendar and in the group also it's a big trouble. Please correct what I have told negatively. Thank you 😊,1
"Password concerns. 3 attempts did not connect. Suggestion: Have a test run before the meetings it may identify ""hiccup"" areas. As we all know, it's not the software, it's always equipment or operator problem.",1
Horrible experience. Audio gets disconnected frequently and mic gets switched on automatically. Not accepting a correct g mail ID also. G meet and zoom are far better than this.,0
Well this is a very good App. But I have 1 question... Does a phone can use a background? Because of my online class.... please make for the iPhone can use a background. THANK YOU 💜,1
Entered a very large meeting and all I heard was the beeping notification from all the people joining and leaving the meeting. I could not hear anything for the first 15 minutes of the meeting do to the online traffic.,0
Can no longer log in,0
We want Estes.,0
"I love in this app how you can make chats with anybody you wnat! Aswell as people from others schools. You can join meetings easily, but sometimes on an ipad if you join it and you get kicked out of it, you can't join it again. You can also call people if your a teacher/adult. I have a lot of friends chats and group chats! Since remote learning me and my friends got to know each other better! I also made a lot of friends through teams. I really like this app! I would recommend it to everybody",2
Updating of everyone's status doesn't seem to happen unless I leave the app open. Everything else generally works as it should.,1
No recording or background changer option in the meet.,1

"We use Teams at work and have a great experience when using it on a computer. Teams for Android seems to be plagued with issues. We have multiple Android users who all have the same issues. Notifications are broken. You might get a notification sound once in a while, but we never get a banner. Calls over WiFi are useless. You can be connected to WiFi all day without an issue. As soon as you get a Teams call, wifi will drop, then connect, then drop, repeatedly.",0
The app is fantastic but in between I get ads in between thats why my video go's off and my teacher shout at me 😅😭,0

Needed this for work. On my personal cell. After downloading and logging in ita asking me to I stall another application that will allow my place of work to access rediculous amounts of information from my phone and give them access to way too much...including wiping my phone. So I uninstalled it and do t plan to install it again u til that can be addressed. My coworkers didnt have to download a secondary application so I'm not sure why mine is saying I need to.,0
This app is not better for online meeting. Required to upgrade it,0
It's a ridiculous app . It's activity is also not working it is showing that you will find notifications here. But it is not showing any of them .,1

"the audio still is really terrible on WebEx. and I think that in general this is a WebEx issue, because it is terrible audio if not using the andriod app, and are on a laptop computer.",0
I really like this app - the calls are clear I have had a few issues with the app not showing me whose on the call.,2

Must be not uninstall,0
It was very lag and even when it updates it has not improved.,0

I would only ask for a Webex-Firefox compatibility, not to change my browser (on pc or laptop) when I have to attend as a guest. When I'm the host, Firefox works fine (when as a guest, I can't hear and can't be heard. Strange, but it happens to me, in three different machines, two laptops and one pc).",2

Getting issue automatically it put me out off meeting and sound issues,0
New update is worst we can't pin 📌 any one in meeting I think you should fix bugs,0
Online learning about good app,1
Good,1
The voice most of time is interrupted +complicated issues regarding setting,0
good,2
"Not bad, I would recommend it. I haven't tried many of these meeting apps, but I like how it is set up and the options they give you when you are in the meeting.",2
GREAT way to keep up!,2
This video calling app is excellent. I attended a webinar session which is an excellent experience.,2
"Lovely.. commendable is the fact that the recordings can be listened to at a later time and even the messages in the chat box can still be viewed. However, the fact that the recordings can't be downloaded is a great limitation.",2
Used to chat with my family arround the world . Good Job,2
Its bakwass app always you have to update it nd secondly great issue is that uhh get great issue in log in 😠,1
Everything is amazing. But the ringtone. It's haunting me. I am hearing it during my sleep too.. OMG..🤯,2
"This app is great 🙂 but...the camera is not really that good ☹️And, I am not eligible to sign in so the app doesn't work that much😭But overall, it is a great app",1
This is a useful app for online classes. But sometimes network problem occurs.,1
Keep disconnecting during my interview even though I had plenty of data,0
I switched to gallery view (where I could see all participants) and could not switch back to having the presenter's PowerPoint fill my screen.,0
"I gave 3 stars because i like this app than other meeting apps and when we have any other net problem we can message on chat box that was so good 👍 ,but this makes my phone slow , on some times it is ok,also when i switch on camera after 5or4 seconds only it will on and i have best net connection also , sometime mic will stuck ,",1
No problem,1
"Great Tool for someone who wants to keep a Therapist, Doctor or other professional but can't travel to see them. I moved and have a professional that I didn't want to change so Go To Meeting is the greatest tool for me. The quality of video and voice is excellent and there are not any kind of bugs to be concerned about.",2
Very slow. Backtracking messages fail most of the time for messages past 2 months.,0
I love this app aleast it doesn't tell us to login or sign in 📱 and I can meet my friends by sending them just a link,2
Not the best. Good app. I would love it more if it had private chat option. But overall a very awesome app. And the update is faster and really cool,1
Ok,1
something went wrong in everything i do.. baaaad,0
I have weekly meetings I MUST do. My face video won't appear. Also did not have the the option. Mute yes. Video no. Never had a problem till new update. Yes I uninstalled and reinstalled already.,0
Nice,2
please remove my camera view from full screen when I'm not using mic or camera. What's the use of full-screen if you gotta add a floating camera box over it. Change the mic icon to botton with a little round corner in red when in full-screen.,0
"Volume now excellent, caption comes on and is not easily found to remove it, caption interferes on with our visits. The words covers the face, please make it easy to turn caption off and on. I would rate this app 3.5 after this issue is fixed I would rate this app 5 star. Otherwise Cisco Webex is a Great App.",2
"Sound was in and out, couldn't get a good feed on presentation. Perhaps it was much-needed and the signal.",0
good love it Workplace help everyone need it,2
"This app is good,But the thing is it shows in the pictures there is raise hand. But when I opened and joined a meeting there is no raise hand please fix that.",2

App unpdet nahi ho rahi,2
Space eater and alway crashes,0
Every time I've attempted to use this app it won't let me hear the meeting I can only see it wants me to go to the web browser that does not load up.,0
"use it for mg school, little problem now though, i cannot open files. ive tried opening my maths homework but it just buffers then nothing happens.",1
"This app is the best app ever for video conferences... I am a student and I have class now in Microsoft Teams but before in Google Meet. After we shifted to Teams, I understood why people refer Meet rather that Teams. I realized how helpful Meet was. We had our exams in Meet and so we didn't face any problem during the exams.. 😊",2
Very good 👍,2
"Pls isme background change krne ke features add kro... Please, please....",1
Very awesome and easy to use,2
Good,2
Good but not ok,2
This is very impotant app,1
"Typically, I know that when I turn on this app.... After 1 to 3,4 hours my mobile it warm up.... So i thought that when I'll seclet any other app it turn down cold so I leave as it was. It just something like this app is saying that (MICROSOFT THEMES IS NOT RESPONDING)then apart of it showed me 3 options down below. 1. Respond 2. Wait 3. Ok So I didn't choose first one, then I choose second one. It was fine for me to attend online class.",1
The app is fine but when i updated it the background changer suddenly gone and now i can't make it back again,1
Disappointed. No cast ability thru chrome either phone or computer. Many oral instructions were not applicable to chrome.,0

This app is not 🚫 working 😭😔 and it is very breaking the zoom app is better than this 😐 a stupid app 🤮🤮🤮,0

Not able to hear anything when called from someone..!! It's so insulting in from of officials...,1
I love this app! It's very convient and helps me to keep in touch with my job whether on my computer or mobile app! I've never had any complications with this app!,2
This app have some many problems I rotated my phone to landscape the presentation suddenly became completely black.Sometimes video is getting blurred even though when my wifi connection is perfect.,0
Please change the grey interface of the meeting... Its kinda unattractive and dark... Change it and then I'll rate the app to 5 stars and improve the review as good..,1
Good,2
"It takes forever to refresh when I open it, I have to stay for like 5mins before receiving new msgs...",1
Everything is doing good but there is no option for post the images in the chat box. During the meeting . If there is an option for post images in chat box it would be more better while attending the meeting. 😊👍,2
Won't mute or unmute,0
Good,1
The application crashed while I was in an important meeting. The sound was bad as people could not hear me,0
"So complicated , doesn't have much benifits",0

Excellent performance,2
I love it!,2
Not so nice,1

Super,2
It is a good app but it is disconnecting for a long time even if we have reconnected to the network. As it is useful in present situation...we don't have any other option.,0
Its very good app for professional and especially learning but its difficult to download,2
"Absolutely terrible app, whenever I change my password I have to uninstall and reinstall the app... Signing out in the app doesn't work and causes a crash.",0
"This app has been great until recently. As other frequent reviews have stated, this app keeps refreshing so you can't log into your account. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling the app DAILY to get into my account. For many people this app is our source of work since the pandemic and this new issues has been very inconvenient. Also, it would be nice to have more camera features for mobil devices such as a blurred or photo background.",0
When typing into the search bar the auto fill would double everything I typed rendering it useless.,0

The video and sound was great. Love the way they're able to go around and back to see everything in the house. Thanks Darrin Bolling Sr.,2
Extremely slow to load chats. The wheel keeps turning. Clicking on the meeting notification takes a few minutes to open the meeting.,0
Worst Application ever !!!,0
"If you're someone who cares about privacy, don't use this app. It's full of telemetry and borderline spyware.",0
Ok,2
Unexpected performance by this app. Great app. Can't change my profile photo. Sent the report also. But no response,2
Sometimes when you mute its doesnt mute instantly so fix that,2
"Muting the phone's audio does not mute the audio (pixel 2 xl). I had all volume settings disabled and it was still playing audio from the speaker. You have to navigate through the settings within the app and disable audio there. Besides that issue, it's been pretty good.",1
"Mine keeps saying that there is no secure connection. I've Uninstalled and installed the app, changed my passwords, cleared all cookies from my browser when I try to open it in a browser. No luck",0

"The app is good... But lacks lot of stability n features... Behavior across desktop n Mobile is so diff. Calls logs vanish, text messages vanish.... So much so that u r never certain of what to expect. Typical of Microsoft products isn't? Good app- has been a lifeline for long professionally n personally.",1
Ist very bad app,0
It is superb for online class and has many and good improvement in this app best quality of presentation and in we don't have 100 percent network screen became blur and eco voice audio this are only problem which should improvement,2
The video and audio worked great for me and the people in my meetings and it wasn't lagging or cutting out at all so I was very surprised by that due to history with other group apps. I appreciate this app alot. Thank you WebEx.,2
"When I used this app, it is good meeting app by Microsoft. But I am unhappy because in this app there is no free spaces between option interfaces by which when we touch accidentaly on screen, the options are clicked accidentaly.By which i face some problems.So,there is need to improvement of this app in giving space.space in interfaces also relaxes by viewing and by which there will some interest in touching option interfaces.",1
Dude this app is so bad fix its bugs about when you update zoom AND IT STILL SAID TO UPDATE IT PLS FIX THIS BUG ITS VERY ANNOYING AND GETTING ME VERY LATE OR ABSENT TO MY CLASSES,0
"It is a good app for a limit, but you should fix that videos take a little bit of time to load even on fast internet, moreover, you should fix the full screen in videos (only the borders color changee from black to white when i allow full screen). There should be a video rotation button. Inaddition, when i pause the video, the start and stop bar still steady and doesn't get away so i can't see anything on the screen. Also, you need to add a button to forward and backtime by 5 or 10 seconds.",0

Useless app,0
Good application. Thanks,2
"Oooo god!! What happened to this app now..firstly it was so smooth nd wonderful. But now I am facing a lot lot network problem..and after the last update what to say, it became more worst.

Good app but needs an option for closed captions in breakout rooms!,1
"This app is great i had no problem with my meeting. Audio was great, picture was great, no issues to complain about.",2
Great to be connected,2
Useless app if you enable two step verification and lost the device,0
Meeting was terrible. Couldn't hear half the people.,0
Quite nice after the new update,2
I loved to use teem It works slow and hangs a lot,1
I don't have a code to sign up,2
Great on laptop but sound on mobile device is choppy,1
"এত বাজে এপস! Poor quality video and images,very poor quality sound system.",0
Reason behind giving 3 star is the app is lagging every time,1
"This application is not working properly on Browser, many times i faced problems during session strating, somes times 3-4 sessions is not connected, I loss that sessions 🙃🙃🙃🙃",0
Hi thank,1
"It's easy to use though, it's lacking some privacy settings. This application is not fully secured for crucial Meetings. I will prefer this application only while taking sessions which, data privacy is not important.",0
it's great i've been using this app for a couple months now and it's great I love the feature how you can deny people from joining your meeting,2
Great👍👏,2
"I almost always struggle using apps and technology, in general. Using this app was extremely easy. The size and font of the icons were clear and easy to see and understand and all of the features worked perfectly on my very first meeting. Thank you to the entire product team for your thoroughness and attention to detail. Excellent product!",2
Good,2
Please 🙏🥺😭😭😭😭 someone should give access code to this app 😭😭😭😭,1
"Starting last night Dec 3, I can only see one person at a time on meetings. Used to be able to see up to 4 at a time. Other friends having the same issue on their tablets. The clearest picture by far of all the video sharing apps!",2

So easy to use and it works great!,2
could not use..,0
Works great when it works like it should. Notifications won't sync with desktop lately. When I click a pop up notification on phone and it takes me to the app chat it's blank. I have to back out and back in to chat. When I click the text box to type it won't pull up. I have to back out of chat and back in. This app is required for my work so I don't have a choice but to use it. Just seems like some bugs need to be fixed.,1
"Random weired glitches on both phone and PC.. Does the dev team use this for comms, I doubt that? Starts for the simplicity and colors.",0
"Won't open on Android 12. 12 has been in beta for most of the past year. This is pretty inexcusable, especially for an app with as large as a userbase as zoom has grown to.",0
So basically I try to join the me and when I type in the meeting code it says there's no such meeting can you please fix that,0
I rated it 4 star because we can't change our password,2
Its good app for meeting but there i a bug its normal when you join meeting but when host join you in the meeting it stuck on preparing meeting,0

Good app easy for online classes,2
Amit ku,2
"The app shouldn't ask for access to my camera, calendar, contacts, location, or phone. The sound was very clear for my Webex meeting, which was great!! I wasn't able to select on the mic. Compared to another virtual meeting tool that I use, the design and set up is ok, but can be a little more user friendly, i.e., trying to figure out how to send a message, etc. Love Cisco though!!! 😊 👌🏼",1
Outstanding collaboration experience more then simple chat or meeting tool. Ties the landscape of Microsoft tools together and allows for realtime collaboration with both internal and external parties.,2

Great application for any conversation.,2
"You should remove the feature where camera is by default enabled in start of the meeting. I just don't like it that without user concern camera is enabled. Also when camera is disabled you should not show that camera rectangular box, it just occupies the screen unnecessarily.",0
Excellent!,2

"Difficult and not intuitive to use, setup is equally frustrating.",0

This app is very slow app and google meet is better than this app,1
The app was working fine until recently but I have recently experienced my front camera freezing with a blue screen on my Samsung A40. I have independently tested my camera using the general test mode by dialling *#0*#.,1
Hope it improves soon,1
Try something more......make sure you have to give the better experience to the user.so the most important thing is to control the meeting with slow internet also.You also think more to get 5 star....,1
Good app but very slow sometimes. Cannot download or upload files without mobile data even though wifi is a 100 megabit Connection.,1
One of the very best Conference Call provider....,2
Great!,2
Earlier it was working fine. But since I updated it. It always have a network issue. Please solve it as early as possible.,1
Nice App. 😊😁,2
Beyond frustrating to get notifications 5 hours later rather than instantly. I have checked all settings and this is the only app that cant get it together,0
Alot of background noise Speakers not audible Information not shared on screen,0
"After i updated zoom, it was not working well like before. When i privately chat with my friend the text they sent me dissappears and somethime when i join a meeting it does not let me in and shows error code 103104 or 5 even though my network and data is fully working and is good. Please try to fix these problems.",2
Very good caller,2
"Its generally good. I would really give it a 4.8 but I wanted to get your attention. We need to have the pinned contacts like we have on our desktops. Another thing, we can't see the participants when we're presenting, this is a real problem.",0

"Great platform for presentations, and sharing screen content, virtually.",2
It cuts out a lot. And it's not my connection because I've got full bars on my Wi-Fi. So just letting you know that yes it cuts out a lot and it's resting because I miss parts of the meeting because I can't hear them.,0
Many Bugs Via Online Class,1

Why tf companies think that giving less option to users and making settings minimal is a cool thing? Its frikkin not!",0

I connect with my brother at a nursing home where there are visiting restrictions. They srt it up so I can use my phone or my ipad. I do appreciate this so much during this pandemic. Sometimes the connection is slow. I do use it to provide as many varied activities as possible.,1
No nice update,0
It's not joining the meeting and because of which every time I am getting delayed for meet in android app.,0
The app keeps glitching in that it is not separating shared mailbox content; it's bleeding into one another and I'm afraid to use it to respond as I'm unsure what mailbox it will show as from,1
same of things doesn't work l it doesn't give right upload so I have to try at library.,0
"Good, but several times the Presenter was stopped by technical issues. I Guess.",2
"Hello MS Corp, I've been using this application from almost 2 years overall great experience BUT if we join any meeting without calendar option the meeting chats appears in chats option not in calendar it is a big mess to delete meeting chats each an every time else it causes difficulty to reply to personal texts ik there is option to pin chats but still it shall be easier for us to handle meeting chats in calendar rather than in chats option.So,hope MS Corp will fix sooner.Thanks.",0

"I have used Zoom for quite some time however I cant remember if if I ever used a Bluetooth speaker with it. Currently i am unable to use one. It makes classes I take on zoom difficult. I have tried both my Galaxy phone and tab, I've changed settings from reading post but nothing works. The speaker works everywhere but zoom and its disappointing",1
"It was good at the start. But now, for the past few days, I have not been able to connect to a meeting although my network is good. It shows 'connecting', and after some minutes, an error would pop out. I've missed quite a few classes. Kindly solve the issue at the latest!",0

Voice break,1
"Please add a lock orientation option (I have lock orientation on device on, doesn't work for the app). How am I supposed to roll around in the bed during a meeting if the screen does a flip everytime as well",2
Easy to log on. Clear pictures with little issues. Easy option for chat and viewing.,2
"I hate this app! Whenever I try to join my class it asks for my password even though the password is already given!!! And sometimes it says that ""We couldn't connect you to the meeting"" Even though my network connection is very strong!! WHAT THE HELL?! IF YOU DON'T FIX THIS MESS I WILL SUE YOU!!! AND I WILL ALSO REPORT THE APP!!!",0
It's fine but it won't let me view .docx and .pdf files. 😠,1
"Please,Hide that logo, while the meeting going on and someone present the presentation, it's becomes difficult to take screenshots.",1
This is very good app but I can't apply any background. But I just request that plz improve that in any phone we can apply background,2
The working of the application was flawless. I would rate it 5 on 5 if I could cast it onto a Chromecast device.,2
Just started,1
Good,1
Excellent app and easy to use for those who are remotely tech savvy.,2
Like everyone else I don't receive my notifications until I open my app which is a serious issue that needs to be fixed,0
Good explanation,2
"Notifications suck. I'll get notifications for dozens of things I've already received and seen. Mentions of your name are treated exactly the same as a stupid thumbs up reaction to a post. The interface is not good. There is no self chat so you cant send yourself notes. Chat functions are more useful than the endless threads in the standard channels, but even the chat windows are unwieldy because they dont give you an option to sort them. I hate most everything about this app.",0
I would like to say that you should add a screen lock option. The mice or video often open by mistake in the online classes.,2
Horrible! It would not download!,0
This app takes too much time in opening and in starting the meeting.,0
Ok,2
"I gave 4 stars because, there's a bug that it makes my device blinking any time so can you please fix this bug so that I can do online class properly ☺️",2

"A big problem, while using with Bluetooth headset, it lower down volume of every app such as instagram ( I can barely hear anything ). This happens in PC version also ( when i mute the meeting my whole system volume gets muted ).Works fine with wires headphones.",1
Let's me communicate with people but is very laggy and keeps kicking me out randomly,0
The information,0
Such a buggy app. Phone vibrates at odd tikes during the call. Call quality is poor at best. Muting and un-muting are cumbersome at best and highly likely to get stuck. Overall there at too many alternates to make this service worth trying.,0
Nice app,2
Nice,2
Worst audio quality,0
For some reason it is EXTREMELY HARD sending messages in the chat while in a meeting. I keep pressing the send button with the power of a thousand suns and it just won't.send. what the heck? It's like I have to find the sweet spot on my phone just to send a message! This Is awful because I have to send messages when the teacher asks us just so they know we are participating...then stupid me has to verbalize that I'm having technical difficulties. Embarrassing.,0

"This app is very amazing! Helps me in school! But the problem is: - Sometimes the camera doesn't work - Sometimes the mic also doesn't work - the raise hand button problem thing However this app is cool! But ofc fix the problems, Thank you❤️",1
Helpful app for office! It would be perfect if it would send me notifications. Also to if it would sync with the desktop app... :(,2

"Can't hear anything on my phone when I have audio set to 'device' and when I set the audio to 'speaker' I can hear everything but cannot adjust the volume at all, neither up nor down. I have what I am given volume-wise. What is the problem here please?",1
Quality has gone down in the last 4 weeks. Hard to connect and getting booted off again,1
Nice,1
I keep getting logged out and have to sing in over and over again. To be frank it's really annoying,0

This app is worse i can't record the sound using other recorder to review the lesson in my school. What a worse,0
It is extremely frustrating that the app tries to call an american phone number instead of joining the conference online. This defeats the purpose of the app entirely.,0
Nice,2
I have to use this app for school and whenever i open it my eyes burn. Both gmail and meet versions. It needs dark theme. I'm sure over 200 people have asked for dark theme already.,0
I have had remarkable experiences using this app. The presenter presentation is clear and precise,2
Very good but no resolution option available please see to it.,2

Good video and audio. No real time chat feature with others,2
"when I go to the any coworker profile, I am not able see his posts. It's always loading. please fix it.",1
the app is so awful it keeps signing out and asking for credentials like every 3 minutes that's so annoying I literally can't use it because it's always asking for credentials + it never loads conversations or file like it barely loads the team front page. seriously awful.,0
good 👍👍👍,1
"On phone, good for listening and viewing shared material. Phone doesn't seem to be the best device for sharing or annotating. My use case is listening while traveling to another location, and being able to contribute to the discussion.",1
Baas ye app teacher ke leliye ban karo,2
Camera Keeps Turning Off Without Notice,1
I am a bit frustrated from your new update. I didn't expect this from google. On full screen my icon always shows on the left topmost corner which hinders from seeing the presentation. I hope you will look into it.,0
Poor video and audio.. taking too much bandwidth,0
The app is best but when I see Google meet in other's Mobile Phone then the screen is short when we go to Home screen during meeting but this system is not in my phone please fix this problems,0

Good,2
I will give this app a 4 star because it has no feature to send a pic or a GIF to anyone. Please. Remove the option to disable chat by host.,2
Absolutely garbage app for Android. No way to change display options so screen changes every 0.25 seconds and I can't display everyone or even a few people during a conference call. Do yourself a favor and use Skype or zoom. You'll save yourself the headache.,0
First time to use,1
This zoom has 999999 .updates updated 3 times in a day. 2 lots and lots glitches to discover.this app is a trash.™,0
Excellent,0
Couldn't unmute.,1

PLEASE GIVE THE OPTION OF REMOVING MEMBERS TO ORGANIZER ONLY. OR ELSE DISPLAY THE NAME OF MEMBER WHO REMOVE OTHERS,0
